Java Service Wrapper Revision History.
--------------------------------------
3.5.54
* Fix issue where the unit configuration file for systemd was created using the
  value of the APP_NAME variable declared in the main shell script ignoring any
  override of the variable in the .shconf file. When the value of APP_NAME
  differed between the two scripts, it caused the installation or removal of
  the service to fail. Since 3.5.47.
* Fix cases where the Wrapper output was duplicated in the JVM output when
  running in Docker.
* Increase the responsiveness to console output from the Java process. To avoid
  high cpu usage, the Wrapper goes to sleep when there is no output from the
  Java process. Output from Java is stored in the stdout pipe until read, but
  will cause the Java process to block when full. Normally this was not a
  problem, but newer MacOS versions appear to have reduced the pipe size to a
  very small size.
* Support for clean shutdown of the Wrapper running as a console when it
  receives a CTRL+CLOSE signal on Windows. This signal is generated when
  closing the console either manually or from the Task Manager. Previously, the
  Wrapper process was simply interrupted, the Java side of the Wrapper detected
  it and requested the Java application to shutdown cleanly. However, at this
  point, any log output were no longer caught by the Wrapper logging system.
  Note that the CTRL+CLOSE signal cannot be ignored and is therefore not
  affected by wrapper.ignore_signals.
* Change the default value of wrapper.jvm_terminate.timeout to 0 (which means
  never time out). Previously the default value was 10 seconds and 5 additional
  seconds were added to the configured value. These 5 seconds are no longer
  added, but values lower than 5 seconds are rounded up to 5 to give enough
  time for the JVM to terminate in most scenarios. In some rare situations,
  like when the memory of the system is saturated, the completion of the Java
  process may take up to several minutes. In such cases, the default behavior
  is now to keep waiting, as the alternative would be to stop the Wrapper,
  which would negate any chance of restarting the application.
* Increase the time to wait before deciding that the thread processing stdin
  it not responding. In very rare cases where the thread was slow, this could
  cause console input to be disabled.
* Comment out the declaration of _PASS_THROUGH at the top of AppCommand.bat.in
  to make it consistent with other script templates. When commented, this
  variable defaults to 'false', which means that any argument after the script
  command are ignored. Previously the value was 'app_args' allowing arguments
  to be passed to the Java Application. When upgrading the Wrapper, if your
  application was using passthrough arguments, please uncomment the property to
  retain compatibility.
* (Standard) Improve the reported message when a Windows file share fails to
  map after an attempt to mount it in the background.

3.5.53
* (Standard) Fix a segmentation fault on UNIX systems when the LANG environment
  variable is not set.
* Do not roll the log file when it is empty.
* Fix a problem with the OSX installer where the /usr/local/opt/wrapper link to
  to the latest installed version was not being created if the /usr/local/opt
  directory did not already exist.
* (Standard) Improve the reported message when a Windows file share already
  exists and it was mapped manually from the File Explorer, this is a different
  error than when the share was mapped from a previous Wrapper invocation.

3.5.52
* Fix rare cases where the Wrapper would fail to initialize stdin resulting in 
  a "Bad file descriptor" error.
* Deprecate wrapper.disable_console_input in favour of wrapper.console_input.
  The new property defaults to 'AUTO', a mode that automatically disables the
  handling of stdin if it is not connected to something to read (e.g. when the
  Wrapper was launched in the background, or when running in a Docker container
  without TTY). This is in order to reduce CPU usage.
* Add a check when starting as a Windows Service to make sure that its name has
  not changed in the configuration since the service was installed. If the
  name has changed, the Wrapper will stop, as this is invalid and could cause
  incorrect behaviour.
* (Standard) Fix a problem mapping shares on system startup caused by a failure
  to resolve the share server name right after the system comes up.  That error
  will now be considered temporary during the startup phase so retrying will
  allow the mapping to succeed.  Implemented a way to continue trying to map a
  share after the service starts to allow for the case where a share server is
  down when the service starts.  Added new
  wrapper.share.<n>.background.retry_interval,
  wrapper.share.<n>.background.failure.action, and
  wrapper.share.<n>.background.success.action properties.
  Change default of the wrapper.share.<n>.startup.failure property to new
  'BACKGROUND'.
* (Standard) When a wrapper.share.<n>.account is specified but the service is
  running as a system account, shutdown rather than ignoring the account
  property.  Continuing could lead to confusing errors.
* (Standard) Change the default value of wrapper.share.<n>.startup.premapped to
  SHUTDOWN, but now check the Network Resource mapped to the existing device
  and ignore the property (so continue) if the location is the same as
  configured.
* (Standard) Fix a bug where writing from/to the elevated process was failing
  if wrapper.lang.windows.encoding was set to UTF-8. This was only an issue on
  Windows and when Administrator credentials were requested.
* Automatically convert the paths referenced in FILES_TO_SOURCE (in the Unix
  Shell Script) to absolute paths. This is done to avoid access issues when
  running as a daemon where the working directory is different from the script
  location.
* Improve systemd detection on Linux (Shell Script).
* Correct link order so that 'lm' appears after the sources in the Linux PPC
  Make file (Community Edition).
* (Professional) Add a 'permissions' command to the Windows AppCommand.bat.in
  batch script to query the permissions of the service.
* Better handling of socket or pipe errors that may arise during the backend
  communication between the Wrapper and the JVM.  In cases of errors that can't
  be recovered, the Wrapper will stop using these channels and decide faster to
  restart the JVM.
* Pause the sending of pings and deadlock check packets when the JVM is not
  responsive. This allows to be more lightweight in scenarios where the JVM (or
  the whole system) is already under high load, and avoids cluttering the
  backend communication unnecessarily. The pinging will resume as soon as the
  JVM catches up.
* Fix issue where 'java -version' was left as a zombie process if it would time
  out.
* (Standard) Add new wrapper.stats* set of property to dump statistics of
  memory and CPU usage for the system, Wrapper process and JVM. Just on Windows
  for now. The wrapper.stats_on_failed_jvm_exit property, which is TRUE by
  default, will cause to dump retroactive statistics in case the JVM is
  detected hung. In addition, statistics dump can be triggered at any time by
  using the 'STATS' keyword in the value of an action property, or from the
  command file.
* (Standard) The Wrapper will no longer try to load a language pack for its own
  messages when English is used. For efficiency and clearer logging.
* Add some default configuration in the wrapper.conf.in to roll the log file.
* The z/Linux distributions are now built on a IBM z14 machine with RedHat
  Linux 8.7 (Glibc 2.28).  Remove 31/32-bit s390 support.

3.5.51
* Fix a bug where some cleanup tasks related to the backend pipe or socket
  (usually performed between a JVM shutdown and the next restart) were being
  skipped. This was only a problem if the JVM had crashed, was frozen or if the
  Wrapper process was abnormally delayed. Since 3.5.47.
* Fix installation failure of Windows Services when using a managed service
  account, a group-managed service account, or a virtual account. Also improve
  the detection of built-in service accounts, which do not require
  authentication.
* Fix an issue on Windows where the 'file.encoding' system property, if
  specified in the wrapper.java.additional.<n> properties, was overridden.
* Improve the behavior when the command used to request the Java version fails.
  For any failure while waiting for the process to complete, an automatic
  restart will be scheduled (as this could simply be due to the system being
  temporarily under high load). If, in addition, the process cannot be killed,
  the Wrapper will stop.
* Fix status message not showing when the JVM was continued (with SIGCONT) on
  macOS.
* Fix a timing issue where some remaining JVM output was sometimes printed
  after confirming that the JVM process had completed.
* Increase the width of the 'W' and 'J' columns of the log format to fit the
  size of the maximum PID value.
* Change the link order of the Make files for the Community Edition, so that
  the libraries appear after the sources. This is done to be more compatible
  with some linkers, which only accept this order.
* (Standard) Fix 'wrapper -h' command not returning any hostIds on Microsoft
  Azure or Hyper-V Virtual Machines.
* (Standard) Improve messages printed when there is a problem with the license,
  and indicate the property name of the key id currently used to help identify
  the problematic property set when the license key file contains multiple
  keys.
* (Standard) Fix a minor logging problem where the 'D' format was displaying
  "unknown" for messages being logged by the main Wrapper instance when 
  wrapper.single_invocation.notify was set to TRUE.

3.5.50
* (Standard) Fix an issue where the Wrapper would sometimes fail to validate
  the license HostId on some Windows installations.
* Fix a log rolling bug where old files were not being purged on Wrapper
  startup if the mode was WRAPPER, JVM, SIZE_OR_WRAPPER, or SIZE_OR_JVM.
  Since 3.5.45.
* Update the MacOS and Windows installer titles to include the architecture.
  This is to avoid confusion between x86 (or universal for MacOS) and arm
  installers.
* Add wrapper.check_certificate.default.loglevel property to control the log
  level of non-critical errors detected when performing trust verification on
  the certificate chain built by the Wrapper.  Change the default log level to
  DEBUG.
* Enhance security when running on old versions of Windows where only SHA-1
  hash algorithm is supported.  The Wrapper will shutdown if the signature of
  the certificate cannot be verified, as is the case for SHA-2 certificates.
* Stop the Wrapper when the counter signature of the code signing timestamp
  was not valid.
* Fix a hung issue on Windows caused by the certificate validation being
  slower than the main thread's execution.  This could happen on machines with
  incomplete certificate installation, and when the Wrapper stopped soon after
  it started (e.g when the configuration is incorrect).
* Improve behavior on exit to wait for threads that are still running while the
  Wrapper still handles CTRL-C signals, and before displaying the final
  "Wrapper stopped" message.
* Fix wrapper.startup_thread.timeout being a few milliseconds shorter than
  configured.
* Add missing '-fPIC' compilation option for FreeBSD 32-bit (lack of this
  option could cause some errors in the execution of the native library).
* Remove redundant log message when the path to the log file is either
  incorrect or doesn't have sufficient permissions.
* Remove misleading status message "JVM process is gone" which was actually for
  the JVM instance launched to get the Java version (UNIX only).
* Improve display of the 'J' column in the log format to only show the PID of
  the Java process when it's existing. Otherwise "-----" is displayed.
* Improve behavior when requesting a thread dump while the Java process doesn't
  exist: skip sending a signal, and simply log a message stating that the JMV
  is not running.
* (Standard) Improve the messages printed when there is a problem with the
  license, and indicate the location of the license key file currently used to
  help when it needs to be replaced.
* (Standard) Remove unnecessary debug message and skip some configuration
  loading when launching the Wrapper with a command that doesn't involve a JVM.
* (Professional) Fix false positive on checking when the JVM process is
  continued if an event command completed while the JVM process was in the
  stopped state.
* Fix potential issue where a SIGCHLD signal from the JVM could be received by
  other running threads of the Wrapper and ignored. This would result in a
  slower detection of the JVM shutdown.
* (Standard) Fix memory issues when using wrapper.timezone or
  wrapper.java.timezone.  Since 3.5.46.
* (Standard) Fix incorrect calculation of the offset when using a timezone with
  'UTC' format if minutes where specified. The detailed timestamps printed with
  wrapper.timezone.debug_timestamps, which showed the offset of the system time
  on Windows, are also corrected.
* (Standard) When wrapper.java.timezone uses (or defaults to) a value with
  'UTC' it is now passed to the command line using the corresponding 'GMT'
  notation to be compatible with Java.

3.5.49
* Fix high CPU usage observed on certain Unix platforms when running as a
  console application.  The Windows platform, as well as daemon installations
  on Unix are not affected.  Since 3.5.47.  Applications using version 3.5.48
  that do not need to handle stdin may circumvent the issue by
  adding wrapper.disable_console_input=TRUE to their configuration file.  This
  workaround is not recommended for 3.5.47 because of another issue (see
  below).
* Reintroduce Solaris SPARC releases in the Delta Pack.
* Fix an issue where the Linux armel and armhf (32-bit) architectures were not
  correctly loading the native library. This was only a problem when using the
  Delta Pack.
* Fix Windows installers that were ignoring the installation directory if it
  was changed by the user.

3.5.48
* Fix a critical bug on UNIX where the Wrapper could get stuck and fail to
  restart if a JVM restart was requested by the JVM or Wrapper.  This would
  happen when wrapper.disable_console_input was set to TRUE, which is the
  default when running as a daemon.  Since 3.5.47.
* Fix a bug on UNIX where console messages would sometimes be truncated,
  causing the next message to start on the same line. This was only a display
  problem and did not affect the operation of the Wrapper.  The log file was
  not affected.  Since 3.5.47.
* Windows versions were unchanged from 3.5.47.

3.5.47
* (Standard) Fix a bug where setting wrapper.share.<n>.startup.premapped or
  wrapper.share.<n>.startup.failure to 'SHUTDOWN' would cancel the action
  specified by wrapper.on_exit.<n>. Since 3.5.30.
* Fix 'Invalid permission eventType: "serviceremote control"' exception when
  using a Security Manager. Security Manager has, however, been deprecated
  since Java 17 and usage is no longer recommended.
* Fix incorrect return code of Windows Batch Scripts when there is a problem.
* On Windows, Oracle Java version 12 and above start using the default code
  page of the UI language (instead of the default ANSI Windows code page). The
  Wrapper will add the 'file.encoding' system property to the command line to
  be able to print the Java output correctly regardless of the Java version.
* Rework the initialization of the Unix Shell Script: improved validation of
  startup arguments, better control of user and permissions, etc.
* Improve the Shell Script so it now updates its SELinux context (type to
  'bin_t') during the installation as a systemd daemon, and restores it when
  removing the unit. This is required to be authorized to start, and only done
  when SELinux is enabled.
* Improve message to indicate the Wrapper log file(s) when the Wrapper is
  launched from the Shell Script and fails to start.
* Deprecate the SU_BIN parameter of the Unix Shell Script. The command to
  substitute the user is now resolved to 'runuser' when present on the system,
  and falls back on 'su' otherwise. This behavior is regardless the start type
  (console or daemon). In addition, the RUN_AS_USER feature will now always
  check that the root user is used.
* Improve handling of signals sent to the process group of the script so that
  they are forwarded to the Wrapper and handled in sync with it. This works
  both when running normally or as a substitute user. In particular, this makes
  it possible to send interruption requests with CTRL-C on the shell when
  running as a user, but also ensures that the script never terminates leaving
  the Wrapper process running in the background. When not targeting a process
  group, it is advised to send the signals directly to the Wrapper process.
* Launch Java in a new process group. This allows the Wrapper to handle signals
  more consistently and solves issues such as the double thread dump happening
  when pressing CTRL-\ or sending a QUIT signal to the process group (UNIX).
* (Professional) Add new wrapper.event.<event_name>.command.new_process_group
  properties to control whether event commands should be launched in new
  process groups.
* (Professional) Add a new setAutoCloseInputStreams() method to the
  WrapperProcessConfig class to make it possible to control the mode to read
  pipes of child processes. The default is now "true" for UNIX. It was
  effectively "false" for previous versions which caused the input stream to
  block if sub-child processes were still using the pipes, or in some cases
  where the direct child process would crash.
* (Professional) More accurate timeouts when using WrapperProcess.destroy()
  and better performances for WrapperProcess.waitFor().
* (Professional) Fix exception being thrown on Windows when launching a child
  process if the working directory was changed.
* Improve the cleanup of monitored child process groups when their group leader
  is terminated but other members are still running. The Wrapper will make sure
  that the group's status is at least checked every 5 seconds.
* Fix a problem where the TestWrapper application in console mode would keep
  prompting an action in an infinite loop if the input stream was closed.
* (Professional) The z/OS distributions are not available for this release.
  Please contact us if you need them, as we may be able to provide them at a
  later date.

3.5.46
* Add a new signed installers for Windows.
* Add new Apple silicon "aarch64" releases.
* Add new FreeBSD 64-bit ARM (aarch64) releases. Built on FreeBSD 13.0.
* Change the architecture name to "arm" for linux 64-bit. "armhf" is still used
  for the 32-bit distributions to differentiate with "armel".
* Stop providing new releases for Solaris SPARC. No usage have been reported
  recently. Please contact us if there is a need for this platform.
* Add additional checks for os.arch on MacOS so only supported "ppc", "ppc64",
  "x86", and "x86_64" will be mapped to the "universal" architecture.
* (Standard) Add new property wrapper.java.timezone to make it possible to
  override the value of wrapper.timezone and configure a different timezone for
  the Java application. Also add the 'SYSTEM' value to let these properties be
  set with the local timezone of the system.
* (Standard) Always make sure to restore the value of the TZ environment
  variable set by the Wrapper prior to launching the JVM.
* Fix an advice wrongly reported when using 'UTC' for the value of
  wrapper.timezone.
* (Professional) Add a new setNewProcessGroup() method to the
  WrapperProcessConfig class to make it possible to control whether or not
  child processes will be assigned to a new process group (PGID).  The default
  is now true for UNIX, it was effectively false for previous versions which
  made it easy to end up with orphaned processes which are launched indirectly,
  such as via an intermediate bash process.
* (Professional) The shutdown of child processes on Wrapper exit, as well as
  when calling WrapperProcess.dispose() were waiting for the soft shutdown
  timeout after attempting to send a CTRL-C to a console child proceess.  Due
  to the way the Windows API works, these CTRL-C signals will never be seen
  by the child process, and the timeout will always be used.  To avoid this
  delay, the Wrapper now immediately terminates console processes as that was
  always the end result anyway.  This will be revisited if a way to send the
  CTRL-C signal can be implemented.  Windows processes are asked to shutdown
  nicely, and then the timeout is used to wait for them to exit cleanly.
* (Professional) Add WrapperProcessConfig.getSoftShutdownTimeout() method for
  consistency.
* (Professional) Fix memory leak when launching a child process with
  POSIX_SPAWN. Also improve the FORK_EXEC and VFORK_EXEC methods to cleanly
  terminate the child process in case an error occurs while creating it.
* (Professional) Add support of POSIX_SPAWN start type for child processes on
  FreeBSD 8+.
* (Professional) Fix log output of child processes not being printed on z/OS
  and improve performances on other platforms.
* (Professional) Fix a warning message on UNIX platforms where the Wrapper
  would report that an event command exited unexpectedly if
  wrapper.event.<event>.command.block.timeout was 0.  The command would
  otherwise complete correctly.  Positive timeouts were working correctly.
* Fix jar files being signed with an older code signing certificate (expiring
  on 2020-12-15 but with a timestamp valid until 2027-06-27). The new
  certificate is the same as the one used to sign Windows binaries and expires
  on 2023-11-19 with a timestamp valid until 2031-01-06.
* Fix wrong path to the id command in the Shell Script. That was mainly causing
  an issue when using RUN_AS_USER on Solaris. The srcmstr daemon must be
  reinstalled after upgrading the Wrapper.
* (Standard) Fix a problem where no hostIds were listed when using NIC teaming
  on Windows Server.
* Normalize paths used in the Unix Shell Script. Non-normalized paths were
  causing certain systemd commands to fail.
* Fix exit code not being set to an error (value of wrapper.exit_code.error)
  when the JVM is being killed because it is unresponsive while stopping.
* Fix GUI of the Demo application not being scaled correctly with Java 9+ on
  Windows. If you were using WrapperManager.nativeGetDpiScale(), you may need
  to precede its call with WrapperManager.nativeGetDpiAwareness() to retrieve
  the dpi awareness of the process, and WrapperManager.nativeSetDpiAwareness()
  to set it to a different value.
* On Windows, automatically switch to monitoring the Java process when it is
  redirected from the process launched by the Wrapper. Use
  wrapper.java.monitor=LAUNCHED to restore the previous behavior and monitor
  the launched process instead.
* Add wrapper.java.monitor.redirect.loglevel to control the log level of
  messages printed if a redirection of the java process is detected and when
  the monitored process changes.
* Fix the log level of some property warnings. Use the value of
  wrapper.property_warning.loglevel.
* Fix an issue where the Wrapper could crash when trying to format a message.
  This was observed when the JVM returned a negative exit code.
* (Professional) Fix 'wrapper -h' returning "No valid HostId(s)" on z/OS.
* Improved German translations.

3.5.45
* Fix a problem where Windows binaries were not being signed correctly in the
  3.5.44 release.  Added additional checks.
* Fix a parsing error causing the Wrapper to hang on startup if the file
  'etcetera' (part of the IANA tz database) was present at the location
  specified by wrapper.timezone.folder. Removing this file would solve the
  issue.
* Add support for encodings added in Java 11 (ISO-8859-16, x-Big5-HKSCS-2001,
  x-IBM1129, x-IBM1166, x-IBM1364, x-IBM833, x-MS932_0213, x-MS950-HKSCS-XP).
* Fix a problem where the Wrapper would fail to start if the shell script was
  on a path which contained multiple consecutive spaces. (Bug #311)
* When building tests (Community Edition), check the presence of a Javascript
  engine instead of assuming its availability based on the Java version. If no
  built-in engine is found, an external engine can be specified by setting the
  'external.js.engine.dir' property when calling Ant. (Bug #313)
* Add a new _WRAPPER_TIMEOUT setting in the Windows batch scripts which makes
  it possible to control the maximum number of seconds to pause on exit when
  there is a problem.  (Feature #136)
* Make it possible to build the Community Edition with Java 10+ by
  automatically using 'javac -h' instead of 'javah'. (Bug #312)
* Use the value of javac.target.version in default.properties (Ant file) as the
  minimum version of Java supported by the Wrapper instead of a hard-coded
  value (useful when compiling the Community Edition).
* No longer show a warning when Java is launched via a script. Instead the
  Wrapper will check that the Java PID is as expected to confirm that Java has
  been launched correctly.
* Fix a problem where the Wrapper would show an error on startup if the stdin
  pipe was not tied to a console window.  This can happen when called within
  other programs.  Since 3.5.43.
* Modify the DemoApp so its internal Wrapper instance no longer logs to the
  main wrapper.log file as that was causing confusion.  Fix an NPE in the
  DemoApp if the Wrapper was shutdown external to the DemoApp dialog.
* Fix a log rolling issue if the current log file was manually deleted or if it
  did not exist because the logging was temporarily turned off. The WRAPPER,
  JVM, SIZE_OR_WRAPPER, SIZE_OR_JVM modes were still rolling the old files and
  the most recent one ended up having a roll number of "2". Now the rolling
  occurs only when a log file without roll number exists.
* Fix an issue where some early messages were logged before the log file was
  being rolled on startup.
* Fix duplicate messages generated while loading the configuration: when the
  path to the configuration file or the working directory can't be resolved,
  when the Wrapper is elevated to control a Windows Service, or in some cases
  when properties are not set correctly.
* Use the configured log file, if possible, when an invalid command line
  property is found or when the Wrapper fails to load resource properties (not
  final). Before a default log file was created in the working directory.
* Fix the log level of some property warnings (wrapper.*.group,
  wrapper.*.action, wrapper.event.<event_name>.email.attach_log). Use the value
  of wrapper.property_warning.loglevel.
* Fix an issue where the pid file was wrongly detected as stale and removed by
  the Shell Script on some Linux systems. This was happening when the path to
  the working directory exceeded a certain amount of characters.
* Make it possible to query permissions of a service with WrapperW. The output
  will be displayed in the dialog window.
* Print the path of the log file when the Wrapper is launched from the Shell
  Script and fails to start.
* Make sure the console output is completely disabled when running as a
  background process on UNIX systems. Previously certain messages generated
  right after startup or while loading the configuration were printed before
  the output was being disabled.
* Fix a bug when the Java version output contained '%' characters. In normal
  situations this should not happen, but there might be such issue when
  wrapper.java.command is not set correctly.
* Print the output of the command used to request the Java version at the INFO
  level if it fails.
* Disable filters for Java version output as they should only apply to the JVM
  output printed by the Java application.
* Fix wrapper.java.command.resolve being ignored when querying the Java
  version (Unix). This is critical because it could cause the Wrapper to stop.
  Since 3.5.44.
* Fix issue on UNIX platforms where jdb was not being detected if used directly
  in the value of wrapper.java.command. See wrapper.java.detect_debug_jvm.
* When jdb or javaw are used as the Java command, their output can't be used to
  parse information such as the Java version or vendor. The Wrapper now tries
  to find the 'java' command in the same directory (or simply 'java' if the
  command has to be resolved using the system PATH), and uses it to query
  information.
* Fix several messages in the script that were not translated because of single
  and double quotes not being escaped correctly. Some also had syntax errors.
* The z/Linux distributions are now built on a IBM z14 machine with RedHat
  Linux 7.8.

3.5.44
* Add a log message when a wildcard classpath, defined with a
  wrapper.java.classpath.<n> property, does not match any files.  The log level
  is controlled with the wrapper.java.classpath.missing.loglevel property.
* Add a new wrapper.java.pid.loglevel property which makes it possible to
  control when the PID of a newly launched JVM is logged.
* Modify the way the -q, -qs and -qp arguments work to query the status or
  permissions of a Windows Service. The configuration file is now required.
  This change is not compatible with the implementation in 3.5.43.
* Update the LSB Init Block in the default shell script so it works more
  smoothly with older Linux systems using update-rc.d.
* Improve logging when the value of wrapper.java.command is not a Java binary.
* Add property wrapper.ntservice.account.logon_as_service to control whether or
  not the Wrapper should add the 'Log on as a service' privilege to the
  configured account during installation of the Windows Service.
* Fix issue where the authentication attempt performed during installation of a
  Windows Service would fail if the configured wrapper.ntservice.account did
  not have the 'Log on as a service' privilege. Since 3.5.42.
* Fix a problem where special service accounts (LocalService, NetworkService
  and LocalSystem) could not be used by wrapper.ntservice.account when
  installing a service. Since 3.5.42.
* Fix a timing problem where the Wrapper would sometimes claim that the JVM
  exited unexpectedly if the JVM requested a stop while starting.
* Sign the binaries in the macosx tar.gz distributions as well as in the
  delta pack distributions.
* Add a new signed and notarized package distribution for macosx.
* Stop providing new releases for Windows and Linux Itanium. The Itanium
  architecture is discontinued and no usage have been reported recently. Please
  contact us if there is a need for these platforms.
* Build the z/OS distribution on z/OS 2.4. Previously z/OS 1.8 was used.

3.5.43
* Rename sh.script.in to App.sh.in in the src/bin directory.
* Create 'App.shconf.in' in the src/bin directory. This template contains a
  copy of all settings of the Shell Script. It is recommended to customize this
  file rather than the Shell Script to simplify Wrapper upgrades.
* Improve customization of the Wrapper binaries to limit failures when the
  target executable is temporarily locked by an external process (often an
  antivirus).
* Fix misleading error messages during customization of the Wrapper binaries.
* Fix bug where calls to WrapperManager.signalStarting() were overriding the
  disabling of wrapper.startup.timeout (when its value is set to 0). This was
  also happening with WrapperManager.signalStopping() and
  wrapper.sthutdown.timeout=0.
* Add new '--conf-optional' option to be used when customizing the Wrapper. It
  allows the target executable to run without configuration file if the
  configuration has been embedded as a binary resource. Without this option,
  the configuration file will be required. Previously, Wrapper with embedded
  configuration were allowed to continue without configuration file, but could
  potentially fail at a later stage.
* Improve logging when the configuration file fails to load, and make sure the
  Wrapper always stops if a file was specified but could not be found.
* Add the ability to query the status of a service by specifying its name
  instead of the configuration file (e.g. 'wrapper -q=testwrapper',
  'wrapper -qs=testwrapper').
* Add new property wrapper.console.quickedit to enable or disable the QuickEdit
  Mode of the console attached to the Wrapper process. The default value will
  disable the QuickEdit Mode as it can cause the Java application to freeze.
* Fix a problem running the Demo Application with the delta pack.
* Add a new WrapperManager.generateDetailedNativeBaseName(baseName) method
  which lets user code generate a base file name based on the current platform.
* Fix a crash that happened when the Wrapper was handling control signals
  during its shutdown process. It had no serious implications because the
  Wrapper was almost stopped and already disposed, but on Windows it caused to
  generate an empty dump file in the working directory.
* Fix a problem where WrapperManager.stop() failed if the native library was
  not loaded successfully.
* Fix misleading debug messages describing the JVM and Wrapper exit codes.
* Raise to STATUS the log level of notifications about the JVM exit whenever
  it ends with an exit code resulting of a crash on Windows.
* Fix 'demoapp' script file not being executable in the bin folder (UNIX).
* Fix some malformed/corrupted messages in German.
* Fix cases where the JVM was detected as 64-bits on 32-bit systems (for debug
  only).
* Fix dialog window not showing if an error occurred while controlling a
  Windows Service with WrapperW.

3.5.42
* Add the ability to query and edit permissions granted to users or groups on
  Windows Services. With appropriate permissions, the Wrapper can control a
  service without prompting the user for Administrator credentials.
* Fix Wrapper not waiting for Network Interfaces when using license keys
  prefixed with HostIds (wrapper.wait_for_hostid=TRUE was ignored).
* Fix an issue where Wrapper instances used to control the Wrapper as a Windows
  Service were writing the output in wide characters (UTF-16). When the Wrapper
  output was piped, the console was reading the pipe output in its code page,
  thus causing a bad character translation.
* Fix output issues when the Wrapper is elevated to control a Windows Service:
  - if wrapper.console.direct is set to TRUE (default), force using only stdout
    to preserve the output order.
  - if wrapper.console.direct is set to FALSE, handle stdout and stderr
    separately (previously everything was redirected to stdout).
  - no longer block when messages are too large.
* No longer prompt for information required to install a Windows Service if the
  service already exists.
* Check that the account and password provided are correct during the
  installation of a Windows Service, rather than on startup. Also, check that
  the account has the service privilege enabled.
* Handle the Windows Service password more securely and load it in memory only
  when required.
* Add new properties wrapper.monitor_exit and wrapper.java.monitor_exit, which
  are used by the --setup (-su) command on Windows to allow the Event Log to
  monitor the Wrapper or Java processes whenever they exit. This is useful to
  diagnose cases where the Wrapper or Java are being killed by another process.
* Change the way HostIds are generated on Windows and allow HostIds tied to
  wireless network interfaces.
* No longer automatically stop a Windows Service prior to updating it. If the
  service is running while the user attempts to update it, the command will
  fail.
* Change the default value of wrapper.java.version.timeout to 30 seconds
 (previously it was 10 seconds).
* Fix cases where the Java version was not resolved to its default value if it
  couldn't be retrieved from the JVM output (for example when
  wrapper.java.version.timeout elapsed). This was causing the Wrapper to stop.
* Add a debug message logged whenever stdout or stderr are reassigned by the
  Java application. This helps understand cases where the standard streams are
  no longer forwarded to the Wrapper output.
* Fix a problem where the code of the Shell Script resolving the status of a
  daemon was checking the presence of some commands which were actually not
  used. This was causing an incorrect status reported when the PATH environment
  variable did not contain the location of the commands.
* Improve the way a daemon is installed and removed using the tools available
  on the different Linux distributions.
* Remove support for Linux PPC-BE. This architecture is discontinued for lack
  of usage.

3.5.41
* Fix java.lang.IllegalArgumentException occuring when printing the usage of
  the WrapperSimpleApp, WrapperJarApp, WrapperStartStopApp integration methods.
* Ignore wrapper.java.additional.auto_bits and
  wrapper.java.additional.auto_bits.<platform> for Java 9 and above. This means
  that the "-d32" or "-d64" options will no longer be added to the Java command
  line. These options were deprecated in Java 9 and their usage started to
  cause a fatal exception after being removed in Java 10.
* Add new environment variable 'WRAPPER_RUN_MODE', which is set to 'console'
  when running as a console, or 'service' when running as a Windows Service /
  Unix Daemon.
* Add new environment variable 'WRAPPER_BASE_NAME', which is set to the binary
  name without the extension, and without the OS, architecture and bits (if
  included in the name).
* Change the name of default configuration file to be the value of
  'WRAPPER_BASE_NAME' suffixed with '.conf'. This means that the default
  configuration file when using the delta pack will no longer include the OS,
  architecture and bits.
* No longer require for a network interface to be active for its HostId to be
  used by the Wrapper.
* Fix delay on startup which may occur when the IP address of the machine is
  resolved via DNS that is not configured correctly (Unix).
* Fix a bug where the Wrapper failed to parse the version of Java and stopped
  when wrapper.javaio.use_thread was set true. Since 3.5.35.
* Fix a bug where the Java version failed to be parsed on certain JVM
  implementations (observed on Raspbian with openjdk 9+).
* Fix an issue where threads were not safely used on HPUX (Itanium and PA-RISC),
  and inside libwrapper.so (Linux and FreeBSD). For instance, this was causing
  repeated log errors when the Java IO thread (wrapper.javaio.use_thread=TRUE)
  was reading no byte from the pipe.
* Fix rare cases where the WrapperW log dialog was displayed without message
  or with garbled characters.
* Add output in the log for a crash dump to make it clear if the Wrapper binary
  had been customized.
* Modify the debug message when a language resource fails to be loaded.
* Fix a crash on Windows when wrapper.lang.windows.encoding was set and the JVM
  output contained certain C formatting sequences like '%s'.  Since 3.5.35.
* Improve detection of Linux distributions in the Shell Script and fix Amazon
  Linux not being recognized.
* Fix a crash when the Wrapper prompts the user for a password during the
  installation of a Windows Service. Since 3.5.33.
* Fix an issue where non-ASCII characters were not read correctly in the
  password input by the user during the installation of a Windows Service.
* Deprecate wrapper.max_hostid_timeout in favour of
  wrapper.wait_for_hostid.timeout, and change the default value to 15 which is
  the maximum number of seconds that the Wrapper should wait for Network
  Interfaces to come up. Previously the default value was 0 to wait
  indefinitely.
* Add new property wrapper.wait_for_hostid.strict to force waiting for a
  specific hostId up to the value of wrapper.wait_for_hostid.timeout. The
  default value if FALSE which tells the wrapper to stop waiting once at least
  one network interface is found.
* Always flush each log output to the log file on startup until the Wrapper
  enters its cycle to monitor the application.

3.5.40
* Fix a segmentation fault on UNIX systems when the user of the Wrapper process
  is not part of the group specified by a wrapper.*.group property.
* Add Full RELRO to all Linux Wrapper binaries (except zLinux and Linux ia64).
  RELRO is a security measure which protects against types of GOT-overwrite
  memory corruption attacks.
* Enhance security with FORTIFY_SOURCE level 2 (buffer overflows detection) for
  Linux (except zLinux, Linux x86 32-bit and Linux ia64) and MacOSX.
* Prevent parallel installations of the Wrapper as a daemon using different
  service management tools.
* Fix wrong status reported when the daemon was installed with systemd and the
  SERVICE_MANAGEMENT_TOOL variable was changed to a different system. This was
  changing the behavior when installing, removing, or printing the status of a
  daemon. Wrong usage or false positive on checking script arguments were also
  observed.
* Fix potential memory corruption when printing the certificate information on
  Windows.
* Add the ability to suspend & resume timeouts while the JVM is running. These
  two actions can be triggered by filters, timers, on a deadlock check, on a
  ping timeout, using the command file, or from the Java code by using the new
  WrapperManager.suspendTimeouts() and WrapperManager.resumeTimeouts() methods.
  This gives a way to tell the Wrapper not to worry about the JVM being
  unresponsive while the Java application is performing a long blocking task.
* Improve the command file by trimming trailing spaces before processing the
  command. Trailing spaces caused to interpret the last argument of some
  commands as empty instead of NULL.
* Fix a rounding issue causing the timeouts of the JVM states to be slightly
  inaccurate (less than one second).
* Fix sh-incompatible syntax issues in the shell script introduced in version
  3.5.38, and version 3.5.36 when RUN_AS_USER is set.

3.5.39
* Add the ability to set the wrapper.*.group properties with a group id.
* Improve logging messages when wrapper.*.group properties are set to invalid
  values.
* Fix an issue where WRAPPER_JAVA_VERSION, WRAPPER_JAVA_VERSION_MAJOR,
  WRAPPER_JAVA_VERSION_MINOR, WRAPPER_JAVA_VERSION_REVISION were not set if the
  Java version failed to be parsed and was resolved to the value of
  wrapper.java.version.fallback or the minimum supported version.
* Fix an issue introduced in 3.5.38 where a daemon installed with systemd would
  fail to start and stop on a system boot or when using systemctl.

3.5.38
* Add support for 64-bit ARMHF platforms (aarch64). Built on SUSE Linux
  Enterprise Server 12 SP4 (glibc 2.22).
* Fix a problem where the Wrapper, running as a console application, and the
  JVM were not cleanly shutdown on Windows Vista, Server2008 and above when the
  user logged off.
* Add new property wrapper.user_logoffs.message to change the message displayed
  by Windows when the Wrapper is stopping and blocking a user log off.
* Fix a problem on UNIX where the Wrapper could hang trying to read from the
  output pipe of a JVM if the fork to launch the JVM process failed. This was
  happenning when the maximum number of processes available for the user
  (ulimit -u) was hit perfectly.
* No longer show debug output "active log file changed" when the configuration
  is loaded.
* Fix misleading messages when setting wrapper.lang to an unknown locale name.
* Stop printing warnings about missing mo files. Only show messages if there
  was an error while loading a language file that exists but is invalid.
* Fix a bug where the Wrapper considered that the wrapperw process had an
  attached console. This was causing several small issues: performance decay
  in case of intensive logging, irrelevant warning about QuickEdit mode being
  enabled, and inability to use certain locales when the OEM encoding, usually
  used for consoles, was not compatible.
* Improve the error message logged when all of the ports in the configured port
  range are already in use.
* Fix a crash in WrapperManager.nativeGetPortStatus() caused by an unhandled
  return code while checking on the status of the port to be used by the JVM to
  connect to the Wrapper (Windows only). This problem was introduced in version
  3.5.27, but has only been seen once. The crash is only possible immediately
  after the JVM is launched. It can also be worked around by using a pipe rather
  than a socket with the wrapper.backend.type property.
* Add new set of properties wrapper.group and wrapper.*.group to change the
  group of several files created by the Wrapper on Unix systems.
* Fix a bug introduced in 3.5.37 where Shell Script invocations during the
  Wrapper execution were deleting the PID file set in the configuration file.
  The status command, especially, was not only deleting the PID file, but then
  also returned a wrong status assuming the Wrapper process was gone.
* Fix a bug where the Java version failed to be parsed on HPUX Itanium. The
  suffix "-hp-ux" being attached to the version was causing the failure.
* Add new property wrapper.java.version.fallback which will be used in case the
  Wrapper fails to parse the output of 'java -version'. If this property is not
  set, the Java version will be resolved to the lowest supported version, but
  the Wrapper will stop when certain properties requiring the Java version are
  used.
* No longer stop the Wrapper when failing to write the lockfile on Windows, and
  allow it to be written by Windows Services. These changes were made to match
  with the behavior on Unix. The lockfile is not used by the Windows system,
  but is made available for external applications that would make use of it.
* Add 'WRAPPER_PERCENTAGE' to represent '%' characters in the values of
  configuration properties. Usage of this variable solves a syntactic ambiguity
  arising when two or more % characters are used, causing the content in
  between to be interpreted as an environment variable.
* Fix '.shconf' file not being loaded when the Shell Script has a '.sh'
  extension.
* Fix a crash when installing the Wrapper as a Windows Service, happening if
  the binaries contained embedded configuration and '-' was used in place of
  the configuration file in the command line used to launch the Wrapper.
* Fix an issue where wrapper.console.flush and wrapper.internal.namedpipe were
  copied to the command line of the Windows Service when the Wrapper was first
  launched for installation without Administrator privileges. This would affect
  performance of interactive services if a console was attached and visible.
* Fix FIXED_COMMAND being ignored when set in the .shconf file.
* Add value 'both' for the PASS_THROUGH variable of the Shell Script & Windows
  Batch files to allow both passing script arguments as Wrapper properties and
  application parameters. See the description in the scripts for usage.
* Restrict usage of arguments passed to the Shell Script & Windows Batch files,
  for only the commands that make use of them, and when PASS_THROUGH is not
  disabled. On Windows, commands that can be used with arguments are 'console',
  'install', 'installstart' and 'update'. On UNIX, only the 'console' command
  and, if not installed as a UNIX Daemon, the 'start', 'restart', 'condrestart'
  commands. Unlike on Windows, arguments are not stored when installing a UNIX
  Daemon, so this restriction was added to avoid cases where the script can be
  manually called with arguments, and automatically launched without arguments
  on a system boot.
* Several small corrections in the Shell Script & Windows Batch files,
  including improved warnings and error messages, and a better help shown in
  case of a wrong command input.
* Add a 'README.txt' file in the bin folder on the Windows releases to explain
  about the popup "Windows protected your PC" that might show up when executing
  the batch files. In production, this readme file can be removed.

3.5.37
* Load the wrapper.ntservice.preshutdown.timeout property during the
  installation of a Windows service and no longer when starting the service.
  The preshutdown timeout value is stored in the service configuration, which
  can only be changed by a user with sufficient permissions, and not all users
  who start Windows Services have these permissions.
* Make it possible to use system locales with an encoding notation that is not
  directly supported by iconv, if the canonical alias for that encoding is
  supported.
* Fix a memory corruption happening when the configured locale encoding is not
  supported by iconv.
* No longer show a warning when the configured locale matches a system locale
  with a default encoding.
* Fix a locale issue when launching the Wrapper with RUN_AS_USER set in the
  Unix shell script. Depending on the OS and how the Wrapper is launched,
  either the 'runuser' or 'su' commands can be used, but until now, only 'su'
  was using the system locale for the forked process. Now, the system locale is
  explicitly passed to the forked process when using runuser to ensure the same
  behavior with both commands.
* Fix the initial value of the time passed since the last JVM output (displayed
  with the 'R' column of the log format), which was '99999999' when launching
  the JVM instance used to get the Java version. It now displays the time since
  the JVM has started.
* Fix heading and tailing tab characters not being trimmed when parsing the
  lines of the configuration file and timezone file. This was causing
  properties and directives preceded by a tab to be ignored.
* Fix a problem where the configuration file could not be read if it contained
  characters that were not supported by the encoding of the context in which
  the Wrapper was launched. It is now possible to change the encoding by using
  wrapper.lang.<platform>.encoding and thus give the Wrapper a second chance
  to read the configuration file and convert it in the correct encoding.
* Fix a problem where include configuration files containing corrupted
  characters were skipped instead of causing a fatal error.
* Add new environment variable: WRAPPER_JAVA_VENDOR. This variable is set after
  the configuration is loaded, when parsing the 'java -version' output.
* Improve handling of the customize command line and logging of errors in case
  it is malformatted.
* Make it possible to skip the configuration file by specifying '-' in the 
  command line used to launch the Wrapper if the binary has been customized to
  embed the configuration. This allows the user to append command lines
  properties after the '-' and override the default configuration.
* Add the ability to register a native exception handler in Windows versions of
  the Java process by passing the -Dwrapper.register_native_handler=TRUE system
  property to the JVM.  This can be useful in tracking down the cause of a JVM
  crash.
* Add new raiseExceptionNative() and raiseFailFastExceptionNative() methods in
  the WrapperManager class which can be useful in testing JVM crash recovery.
* Make it possible to combine log rolling by date with any other existing modes
  (SIZE, WRAPPER, JVM, SIZE_OR_WRAPPER, SIZE_OR_JVM).
* Change the default value of wrapper.logfile.purge.sort to 'NAME_SMART' for
  all rolling modes. Before the default value was 'TIMES' except when rolling
  by date. 'NAME_SMART' will purge the log files sorting them using the dates
  and indexes included in their names. With this mode, the files will always be
  purged in the correct order without being affected by manual edits which
  cause their last modified dates to be changed.
* Add a warning on startup when the Wrapper is running in a console with
  QuickEdit mode enabled (Windows), and a property 
  wrapper.console.quickedit.loglevel to control its log level. The QuickEdit
  make it easier to select text in the console, but should be used with caution
  as selecting text will freeze the Wrapper and block the Java application.
* When running the delta pack on a 64-bit OS, the script launching the Wrapper
  will first send a request to resolve whether the license is 32-bit or 64-bit,
  then launch the appropriate Wrapper binaries. Before the binaries matching
  the OS bits was used.
* Add an optional source file which can contain the customized configuration of
  the UNIX shell script. This file will be executed after setting the variables
  on the top of the script, giving the user a chance to override any of them.
  The file must have the same basename as the script and suffixed with a
  '.shconf' extension. This should allow the user to keep the shell script in
  its original state, and make it easier to upgrade it.
* Set the default values of the APP_NAME and APP_LONG_NAME variables in the
  UNIX shell script. APP_NAME will default to the name of the shell script,
  and then APP_LONG_NAME will default to the value of APP_NAME.
* Add a property wrapper.forced_shutdown.delay to control the minimum amount of
  time required between two CTRL-C or TERM signals to initiate a forced
  shutdown. The default value is 2 (200ms) to prevent double signals from
  forcibly shutting down the application.

3.5.36
* Add new properties wrapper.java.additional.<n>.java_version.min and
  wrapper.java.additional.<n>.java_version.max to allow passing different
  options to the JVM depending on the Java version.
* Allow WRAPPER_JAVA_HOME to be updated on each JVM restart. This variable is
  set when the Java command is located using the Windows registry and cleared
  when using wrapper.java.command. Previously, this variable was final, meaning
  that once it was set it could not be changed, causing potential mismatch with
  the location of the Java command being used.
* Ensure that a variable cannot be set by the user if it is also used by the
  Wrapper internally. Before, this was only done for certain variables but not
  those set after the configuration is loaded (such as the WRAPPER_EVENT_* and
  the WRAPPER_JAVA_HOME variables). For any conflict, a warning message will be
  logged and the value set by the user will be ignored.
* Add new environment variables: WRAPPER_JAVA_VERSION,
  WRAPPER_JAVA_VERSION_MAJOR, WRAPPER_JAVA_VERSION_MINOR and
  WRAPPER_JAVA_VERSION_REVISION. These variables are set after the
  configuration is loaded, when parsing the 'java -version' output.
* Add new environment variables WRAPPER_VERSION and WRAPPER_EDITION.
* Deprecate wrapper.environment.dump in favor of
  wrapper.environment.dump.loglevel and generate a new dump each time the
  configuration is reloaded if wrapper.restart.reload_configuration is set to
  TRUE.
* Add new properties wrapper.java.additional_file.required and
  wrapper.app.parameter_file.required.
* Allow the Wrapper to be launched without specifying a configuration file if
  the binaries have been customized with embedded properties.
* Fix insufficient buffer size causing the Wrapper to crash when printing large
  messages in UTF-8 on Windows.
* Change the default value of the #properties.on_overwrite.loglevel directive
   to 'AUTO' which is resolved to:
   - 'WARN':
     - When a property is overridden within the same configuration file or in a
       file with a lower include depth than the file of the previous
       definition;
     - When a final property embedded during customization is overridden.
   - 'DEBUG': in all other cases.
* Fix an issue where the Wrapper ignored systems properties surrounded by
  double quotes and referenced in the wrapper.java.additional.<n> properties
  (Windows only). Instead of giving priority to the properties of the
  configuration file, the Wrapper was creating duplicates in the Java command
  line when using the same system properties internally.
* Fix an issue where environment variables were expanded too early while
  embedding configuration properties into the Wrapper binaries. Now they are
  left untouched and expanded at runtime. During customization, the properties
  and variable definitions will be stored as a binary resource in the original
  order of the configuration file to ensure that variables will be expanded
  with the same rules as when loading from the file.
* Fix a bug where the Wrapper failed to parse the Java version if some system
  messages were inserted before the JVM output.
* Fix a bug causing the Wrapper to sometimes freeze or crash when launching a
  child process on UNIX systems other than Linux (observed on AIX).
* Enable the wrapper.console.title property to be reloaded when
  wrapper.restart.reload_configuration is set to TRUE.
* Use the '-K PIC' option instead of '-K pic' when compiling the Wrapper 64-bit
  binaries (but not for the native library) on Solaris SPARC. This was required
  as the size of the binaries increased, but should not affect the Wrapper
  behavior.
* Add a new property wrapper.registry.java_version, which makes it possible to
  target a specific version of Java when locating the command using the Windows
  registry. If this property is not set, the Wrapper will use the
  CurrentVersion string of the registry. Note that Java 9 and above use a
  different location in the Windows registry, so by default the Wrapper will
  first search in this new location to prefer recent JVMs.
* Fix a bug where a daemon installed with systemd would fail to start if the
  path to the shell script contained spaces.
* Fix corrupted messages logged by the native library if the system encoding
  and the JVM encoding were different. This was most noticeable when using
  localization on Windows (on UNIX systems, this would only occur if
  'file.encoding' was manually added to the JVM options).
* Add a check to make sure that the UNIX shell script can be accessed using an
  absolute path. If not, the permissions to each intermediate folder will be
  listed and the script will stop.
* Other small fixes, performance improvements and corrected log messages.

3.5.35
* Fix a bug where the icon of the hidden console allocated by wrapperw
  reappeared in the taskbar whenever the Java application opened a full screen
  window. If this would occur the icon will be quickly hidden, but a flicker
  may be observed on the taskbar as the icon will still briefly show up.
* Fix a bug introduced in 3.5.31 where setting wrapper.logfile to a blank value
  was not disabling file logging. Instead the Wrapper was showing a warning and
  fell back using the default log file in the working directory. This version
  restores the ability to disable file logging with a blank value.
* Handle the backend communication (via pipe or socket) from the native Wrapper
  to the JVM in UTF-8. Before, the encoding of the current locale was used, but
  some encodings could not support all characters when the Java side of the
  Wrapper was reading the configuration.
* Fix string conversion issues on the native library happening when the JVM was
  using a default encoding that did not match the system encoding. This
  resulted in unreadable JVM outputs.
* Add the ability to parse any encoding specified in the JVM arguments (via
  file.encoding, sun.stdout.encoding or sun.stderr.encoding) and read the JVM
  output using the same encoding.
* Deprecate wrapper.lang.encoding in favor of wrapper.lang.unix.encoding and
  add wrapper.lang.<platform>.encoding to specify an encoding per platform.
  While Unix systems often use the same syntax for encodings, Windows uses code
  pages instead of names. The new created set of properties helps setting the
  encoding used by the Wrapper in a cross-platform way. The specified value
  will be both used to encode the JVM output and the Wrapper log output.
* Improve portability of wrapper.lang.unix.encoding. If its value doesn't match
  any encoding of the locales installed on the system, the Wrapper will search
  for a match with a different notation of the same encoding (without case
  sensitivity, dashes, etc.).
* Add wrapper.jvm.encoding to control the default encoding of the JVM. Usage of
  this property requires Java 8 and above, and should be limited to cases where
  the encoding of the JVM has to be different from the Wrapper output encoding.
  Otherwise wrapper.lang.[windows|unix].encoding is preferred.
* Improve the way the encoding is passed to the JVM on the different platforms:
  - On Windows, since version 3.5.8 (Professional and Standard Editions),
    file.encoding was added to the JVM arguments to ensure that the Wrapper
    always reads the JVM output using a suitable encoding for its own language
    regardless of the OS language. However it forced the Java application to
    use an encoding that may not be appropriate. From now on, the encoding is
    passed to the JVM only if wrapper.lang.windows.encoding or
    wrapper.jvm.encoding are set, or if the version of Java is older than 7
    (recent versions of Java have their default encoding set to the default
    ANSI Windows code page, like the Wrapper, but that was not always the case
    on older versions of Java).
  - On MacOSX, JVMs older than version 7 have their default encoding set to
    "MacRoman" regardless the current locale. This caused some encoding issues
    because the Wrapper uses the encoding of the locale to read the JVM output.
    To correctly read the output of those JVMs, the Wrapper sets file.encoding
    to the locale encoding (unless it is already present among the JVM
    arguments).
  - On all other UNIX platforms, the JVM encoding is automatically resolved
    from the current locale, so it is only added to the JVM arguments if
    wrapper.jvm.encoding specifies a different value.
* On Windows, user.language and user.country will be set and passed to the JVM
  whenever wrapper.lang differs from the language and country of the UI.
  Previously only user.language was passed.
* Make it possible to use wrapper.lang.folder, wrapper.lang.domain,
  wrapper.lang.window.encoding and wrapper.lang.unix.encoding without setting
  wrapper.lang. This can be useful if any of this configuration needs to be
  changed while still using the default language of the OS. On Windows, if
  wrapper.lang is set to 'DESKTOP' or 'DEFAULT', the encoding must be set to
  'ANSI', 'OEM' or 'UTF-8' to ensure a correct encoding through the different
  platforms.
* Fix garbled messages when exceptions are raised from the native library on
  UNIX.
* Fix an issue where the Wrapper failed to load a language pack (*.mo) other
  than those provided by default (German and Japanese).
* Fix wrong exit code (0) returned in case the Wrapper would fail to launch a
  JVM.
* Allow wrapper.exit_code.error to be used at an earlier stage if the Wrapper
  has to stop while loading the configuration (for example when duplicate
  properties are found with #properties.on_overwrite.exit being set to TRUE).
* Allow the CPU affinity of the Wrapper process to be changed when the
  configuration is reloaded.
* Add wrapper.java.version.min and wrapper.java.version.max to control the
  versions of Java for which the Wrapper is allowed to run. Out of the
  specified range, the Wrapper will stop.
* Fix wrapper.console.title being ignored with wrapperw.exe and
  wrapper.ntservice.console set to TRUE.
* Add four customization options (properties-default, property-file-default,
  properties-final, property-file-final) to include configuration properties
  into the Wrapper binaries (Windows). The properties specified with the
  'default' options can be overridden from the configuration file or the
  command line, whereas those specified with the 'final' options are marked as
  final and cannot be overridden.
* Add a new property, wrapper.properties.dump.format, to print various kinds of
  information when dumping configuration properties. Note that the default
  formatting changes from 'NAME=VALUE' to 'SOURCE | FINAL | NAME | VALUE'.
* Add a new property wrapper.test.no_jvm. By setting it to TRUE, the Wrapper
  will run until it is about to launch a JVM and then will shutdown. This can
  be useful to test a configuration, confirm the license status, check
  properties or environment variables dumps, etc. without starting the Java
  application.
* If wrapper.timezone is set, -Duser.timezone will be added to the Java command
  line to synchronize the time between the Java application and the Wrapper. It
  is possible to pass a different timezone using one of the
  wrapper.java.additional.<n> properties, in which case the Wrapper will not
  add its own timezone to the Java command line.
* Improve Linux distribution detection in the shell script by checking that
  update-rc.d is present on the system before installing the daemon. This
  corrects an installation failure on Amazon Linux AMI.
* No longer use IBM Advanced Toolchain when building the Wrapper for Linux
  PPC-LE. Advanced Toolchain was introduced in v. 3.5.34, but since then some
  users reported that the Wrapper binaries could not be executed on their
  machine.
* Fix a bug happening on Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, Amazon Linux AMI and
  Fedora, where the logfile was not rolling if the ROLLNUM token was used
  inside the value of wrapper.logfile.
* Always make sure to process queued log messages before the Wrapper exits on
  UNIX platforms (previously this was only done on Windows).

3.5.34
* Fix a memory access violation when the Wrapper uses localization files.
* Fix minor memory leaks (after validating the certificate and when launching
  child processes).
* Improve logging when establishing connection to an SMTP server and when
  sending emails.
* Dual sign the Wrapper binaries with SHA-1 and SHA-2 hash algorithms and
  timestamping to allow stronger verification at the OS level while keeping
  compatibility with older versions of Windows that don't support SHA-2.
* Add parameter "--silent" to never show the log dialog when customizing 
  wrapperw.exe.
* Return an exit code of 1 whenever the customization of wrapper.exe failed. 
  Previous versions were always returning 0.
* Improve the detection of the location of several commands used by the shell
  script when performing actions like detecting the service management tool.
* Remove the ID_BIN variable defined on the top of the script file, as it was
  ignored on most platforms. The location of the id command is now
  automatically resolved.
* Fix methods of the shell script to restart a daemon installed with launchd
  or upstart. They behaved like 'condrestart', which means they exited with an
  error code of 1 if the service was not running.
* Fix the condrestart command of the shell script to use built-in restart
  methods of upstart, systemd, launchd and src, instead of performing a stop
  followed by a start.
* Improve messages when starting/stopping/restarting the Wrapper daemon with
  the different service management tools available on Unix systems.
* Fix errors when querying the status of a service on AIX without being root.
* Add a new property, SYSTEMD_KILLMODE, in the shell script to control how
  systemd should kill the Wrapper child processes on shutdown. When using the
  Professional edition, it may be useful to set this property to 'process'.
  This will prevent systemd from killing detached child processes that should
  normally be left running on shutdown.
* Many improvements in the Japanese and German translations.

3.5.33
* Fix a false positive when detecting Upstart on Linux.
* Fix a bug where it was required to register the Wrapper to the Event Log on
  Windows in order to send messages to a remote syslog server via UDP.
* Fix a memory leak when sending messages to a remote syslog server. Since
  3.5.27.
* Fix wrong exit code when the Wrapper was configured to shutdown on a ping
  timeout. The exit code was always 1 whereas it should be the value of the
  wrapper.exit_code.error property.
* Check that the configured service management tool is available before
  installing a daemon on Linux and return an exit code of 1 whenever the
  installation fails.
* Add new properties wrapper.ulimit.data.{soft|hard} to limit the size of the
  data segment of any process started by the Wrapper. It is similar to running
  the command "ulimit -d X" in a terminal.
* Improve the processing of the command file by ignoring blank lines and any
  spaces before the command.
* Correct invalid exit code that may be written in the command file along with
  a STOP command. If the exit code is out of the range 0-255, it will be
  resolved to the value of the wrapper.exit_code.error property.
* Improve messages when the Wrapper is paused or resumed.
* Fix a bug where, on certain UNIX platforms, the locale was not correctly set
  from the environment at startup.
* Fix a bug on FreeBSD where conversions of JVM outputs to a different encoding
  (specified with wrapper.lang.encoding) systematically failed because the
  iconv library was not loaded by the native library.
* On FreeBSD, it has been observed that certain versions of iconv fail to
  convert some characters like backslashes when the SJIS encoding is specified.
  In such case the Wrapper will consider SJIS as unsupported and fall back
  using the encoding of the console which launched the Wrapper.
* Fix garbled question marks that appeared in messages logged while performing
  actions (install, start, pause, etc.) on a Windows service when the Wrapper
  language was different than the system language.
* On Windows, instead of printing system errors in the language of the UI, the
  Wrapper will now first try to use the language specified in the configuration
  (English for the community edition).
* Enhance security by adding a linker option to enable ASLR (Address Space
  Layout Randomization) on Windows Vista and above (Windows Itanium not
  supported), and by attempting to enable DEP (Data Execution Prevention) right
  after the Wrapper is launched (Windows XP SP3 and above). DEP enforcement
  will only affect 32-bit versions as Windows automatically enables DEP for
  64-bit binaries.
* Fix double thread dump issue when pressing CTRL-\ while the Wrapper is 
  running as a console on Linux. The problem remains on other UNIX platforms.
* Fix a problem where backslashes in the path of the log file, configured with
  the wrapper.logfile property, were not being handled correctly resulting in
  the Wrapper being unable to create the log file (Unix only).

3.5.32
* Fix a bug introduced in 3.5.31 where the Wrapper did not clean up child
  processes when shutting down.
* Fix a bug on z/OS where commands were ignored if the command file contained
  an EBCDIC newline character.
* In the script file, stop using "runuser" when running the Wrapper in console
  mode and use "su" instead to handle signals properly.
* In the script file, it is now possible to pass options to the command
  "runuser" with $SU_OPTS.
* Fix an issue where some messages coming from Wrapper invocations used to
  control the Wrapper as a service were not marked with the "wrapperm" logging
  source.
* Fix a memory fault happening when the Wrapper exits after failing to write
  the pid file. This was causing to return 139 instead of the normal exit code.
  Since 3.5.31.
* Fix a minor memory leak when sending emails.

3.5.31
* Fix script file to resolve the architecture name correctly on Z/Linux.
* Change the default behavior of the script file to automatically detect the 
  service management tool on Linux and AIX. See 'SERVICE_MANAGEMENT_TOOL' in
  the script file.
* Add new properties wrapper.ulimit.nofile.{soft|hard} to limit the use of open
  files. It is similar to running the command "ulimit -n X" in a terminal.
* Fix a bug introduced in 3.5.30 where the log file was opened for outputs with
  a log level lower than the value specified by wrapper.logfile.loglevel. This
  could cause a performance issue if the wrapper.logfile.close.timeout property
  was set to a low value as it would cause to reopen the file regularly.
* Fix a bug where messages generated shortly after the Wrapper starts could not
  be redirected to the configured log file. This was happening when using a
  custom working directory and when the path to the log file was set relative
  to it.
* Fix issues when processing queued log messages which could result in minor
  memory leaks and dysfunction in the way log file change events are fired.
* Fix a problem where the log rolling by date stopped working if at some point
  the Wrapper could not access the configured log file and switched to the
  default log file. From now on, the rolling will continue as soon as the
  configured log file becomes available. As for the default log file, it is
  always set up to roll with another single file, each file having a size limit
  of 5Mb.
* Fix misleading error messages when the Wrapper fails to write in the log file
  or fails to terminate the JVM process. The system error codes and their
  descriptions were incorrect.
* Several improvements when the Wrapper switches to a different log file.
  When the log file was not accessible, if its path was changed and the
  configuration reloaded, the Wrapper failed to resume into the new log file.
  Also improved log notifications whenever the log file changes.
* Improve how the Wrapper checks if there is a source for the Windows Event
  Log. Before, this was done on the first message being logged. Now, this check
  is done at launch time for better performance and readability. If there is no
  source registered, the logging to the Event Log will be disabled, with the
  exception of critical messages such as when the log file changed.
* Several improvements in the log outputs such as wrong entries in the property
  dump, double outputs, thread messages being inserted in the middle of
  multi-line messages, etc.
* Fix a bug where the Wrapper did not stop even though the action specified
  by wrapper.event.wrapper_pause.command.on_exit.<n>=SHUTDOWN was triggered.
* Several improvements and bug fixes related to time zones, especially when
  parsing the IANA time zone file.
* Add new WrapperManager.getOS() and WrapperManager.getArch() methods to make
  it easy to access the same resolved OS and architecture used by the Wrapper.
* Fix a buffer overflow problem happening when collecting HostIds if the number
  of adapters on the local machine exceeded 10. Also improved the display of
  HostIds when calling 'wrapper -h'.
* When launching the Wrapper in console mode, the UNIX shell script will now
  return the exit code of the Wrapper. When using the start action, the script
  will not wait for the Wrapper to finish and will not return its exit code.
* Add a new property, wrapper.exit_code.error, which allows the user to specify
  the exit code to use when the Wrapper stops with an error.  This can be used
  to distinguish the Wrapper exit codes from other codes that the Java 
  application may return.  Note that this will only take effect after the
  configuration has been loaded.
* Correct the exit code of a child process launched by WrapperManager.exec()
  on UNIX platforms when it exited due to a crash.
* Several bug fixes and improvements when setting the language and encoding.
  If the configuration doesn't match with any locale installed on the system,
  the Wrapper will try using a similar locale ignoring case and modifiers.
  See the Internationalization/Localization page for details.
* Stop setting the LANG environment variable on Windows.
* Fix a problem where wrapper.lang.encoding was ignored if the LC_ALL
  environment variable was set on the terminal that launched the Wrapper. To
  solve this issue, LC_ALL is now set by the Wrapper with the same value as
  LANG. This only applies to UNIX platforms when wrapper.lang is set.
* Due to changes in the way locales are set, the value of the WRAPPER_LANG
  environment variable may be affected. This variable was and is still set with
  the 2 first characters of the locale used by the Wrapper, but it is now
  always lowercase. This makes it match with the suffix used in the language
  file. On the community edition, the value is always 'en'.
* After a ping timeout takes place, the Wrapper will no longer wait for
  wrapper.shutdown.timeout to elapse and will immediately kill the JVM if a
  RESTART or SHUTDOWN action was specified. A hung JVM process can't be shut
  down cleanly, so there is no need to wait for an additional timeout.
* Deprecate the use of the wrapper.event.<event_name>.email.attach_log
  properties in favor of wrapper.event.<event_name>.email.maillog. These
  new properties make it possible to control if the logs should be sent as an
  attachment and/or directly in the body of the Notification emails. Also note
  that, unlike the deprecated properties, logs inclusion can now be set for
  individual events without activating it for the "default" event type.
* Add new actions PAUSE, RESUME and CLOSE_LOGFILE to the signal properties
  wrapper.signal.mode.hup, wrapper.signal.mode.usr1 and
  wrapper.signal.mode.usr2. CLOSE_LOGFILE can be used to force the Wrapper to
  recreate a new log file after it has been moved or renamed.
* Add the possibility to pause and resume the Wrapper from the UNIX shell
  script. Two modes were added and can be activated with the PAUSABLE_MODE
  variable. The first mode, which is the default, uses the SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2
  signals to request pause and resume. The second mode uses the command file.
  By default the script will not allow pausing or resuming unless the PAUSABLE
  variable is explicitly set. When this feature is activated be aware that
  depending on the mode, wrapper.signal.mode.usr1, wrapper.signal.mode.usr2,
  or wrapper.commandfile will be passed as command properties to the wrapper
  and thus override the corresponding properties of the configuration file.
* Add event handler methods to the Demo application to show how to handle the
  service control event sent by the Wrapper when wrapper.pausable.stop_jvm is
  set to FALSE.
* Stop allowing the Wrapper to run when versions of the Wrapper executable,
  native library, and jar file do not match. The Wrapper had always shown a
  warning then attempted to continue, but this would often lead to
  unpredictable behaviour and some features simply not working. Please be sure
  to upgrade all Wrapper files when upgrading the Wrapper.
* Deprecate the use of the wrapper.command.poll_interval and
  wrapper.anchor.poll_interval properties in favor of
  wrapper.commandfile.poll_interval and wrapper.anchorfile.poll_interval.
* Fixed a rounding issue causing the intervals between two pings or two
  deadlock checks to be 900ms shorter than the value specified in the
  configuration.

3.5.30
* Improve the logging messages when using the IANA timezones introduced in
  version 3.5.29 and add a new property, wrapper.timezone.debug_timestamps, to
  display additional information (offset to GMT and whether DST is in effect)
  in the timestamps of the log outputs.
* Improve the behavior when the Wrapper fails to parse the timezone file or
  fails to resolve daylight saving time. Any error on startup will cause the
  Wrapper to fall back to system time. If an error would occur during a time
  change, the Wrapper will continue with the current time.
* Add new properties wrapper.ntservice.preshutdown and
  wrapper.ntservice.preshutdown.timeout to allow Windows services with a long
  shutdown time to stop cleanly before the system starts its shutdown process.
  The first property specifies that the service will accept PRESHUTDOWN
  notifications. The second property tells the service control manager how
  long to wait until the service stops. These properties are not supported on
  Windows Itanium or Windows XP and lower.
* Fix a memory leak on Fedora 21 and lower. This issue was fixed for RHEL,
  CentOS and Amazon Linux AMI on version 3.5.28, but was still happening on
  Fedora when rolling the log file in size mode.
* Fix a bug where, under certain conditions, a white square appeared briefly
  on the screen just before the splashscreen was drawn (wrapperw).
* Change name of the architecture for Linux PPC. Since 3.5.29 the Wrapper is 
  available on Linux PPC little-endian and big-endian. To avoid confusion 
  'linux ppc' is now 'linux ppcbe' and 'linux ppc64le' becomes 'linux ppcle'.
* In the script file, add the variable FILES_TO_SOURCE which should contain a 
  list of files to source prior to executing any commands.
* Add two tokens, 'W' and 'J', to the logging format to display the Wrapper
  process id and the Java process id.
* Fix a bug where the Wrapper stopped to log messages coming from the Java
  application, or one of its child process, when it encountered a null
  character (\0). It also resulted in a memory leak if the Java application
  was logging messages at a frequency higher than the value specified with
  wrapper.log.lf_delay.threshold.
* Fix a wrong implementation of the property 'wrapper.log.lf_delay.threshold'.
  The amount of time specified by this property was counted from the last log 
  output received instead of the last line feed received.
* If the Wrapper is unable to write to the configured wrapper.logfile, it would
  fall back to a default log file in the working directory. If this would also
  fail, the log file will be disabled and logging will only continue in the
  console, syslog or EventLog. From 3.5.30, the Wrapper will resume logging
  into the configured file as soon as it is available again. If the log file
  had been disabled and the configured log file would still be locked, then it
  will try to resume the logging in the default log file.
* Fix a bug where a RESTART or a PAUSE action specified with
  wrapper.on_exit.<n> (or wrapper.on_exit.default) would abort a SHUTDOWN
  triggered by an event, a filter, a timer, a deadlock, a ping timeout or
  failures of mounted shares.
* Improve the logging messages when the action 'KILL_RESTART' is specified for
  the 'wrapper.event.<event_name>.command.block.action' property. Depending on
  the event, RESTART is not always applicable, but the Wrapper always notified
  that a new JVM was going to be launched. Now it will clearly inform when the
  restart is not applicable.
* Improve the output when querying the status of a service on Unix. It will
  show whether the service is installed or not, and which system is used if
  there are several possibilities for the current OS (init.d, systemd, etc.).
* Fix a bug where the daemon was not reloaded when the Wrapper was installed
  using systemd and a custom service file.
* When installing a daemon with systemd or upstart, the Wrapper will now check
  for a previous install like it does for the other init systems. This implies
  that the service should first be removed to force reinstallation.
* Add the ability to log the properties each time the Wrapper loads or reloads
  the configuration file. A new wrapper.properties.dump.loglevel property was
  created to control at which level they will be logged.
* fixed a bug happening when launching multiple instances of the shell script
  in a short time interval. If one instance was starting the Wrapper while
  another attempted to stop it, the PID file of the new Wrapper process might
  eventually be deleted. Running without a PID file could cause some issues and
  would leave open the possibility for a second instance of the Wrapper to run
  simultaneously even though wrapper.pidfile.strict would be set to TRUE.

3.5.29
* Fix two problems when wrapper.lang.folder was passed in the command line to
  the JVM. The path was limited to 78 characters and was not put in quotes on
  Windows.
* Add new supported platform: Linux PPC64LE 64-bit. Built on a RedHat 7.1 LE
  machine, GNU libc 2.17.
* Fix a bug happening on startup where timers set with an interval less than
  wrapper.timer.max_catchup were executed several times.
* Add a dynamic variable 'WRAPPER_SYSMEM_<P>' where <P> is a percentage of the
  physical memory available on the system. This variable can be used in the
  wrapper.java.additional.<n> properties to set the values of JVM options like
  -Xmn, -XX:PermSize or -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize.
* Fix a bug on AIX where the properties wrapper.java.maxmemory.percent and
  wrapper.java.initmemory.percent did not work because the Wrapper failed to
  get the physical memory size of the system.
* Fix script (AIX only) to allow users to start and stop the Wrapper without
  using SRC and fix syntax error in a message when validating the size of
  APP_NAME.
* Add the possibility to specify a timezone of the IANA tz database in which
  the Wrapper will be executed. Although the old timezone abbreviations are
  still available for backward compatibility, usage of the new IANA identifiers
  is preferred because it solves several issues, especially regarding daylight
  saving time. By default, summer/winter time changes are automatic and will
  update timers, mail settings and time-stamps of all log outputs.
* Fix script for MacOSX where users could only start the daemon if it was
  installed. Now it is not necessary to install it. Introduced in 3.5.28.
* Improve a workaround to a bug in a libc function on AIX which causes memory
  errors when messages containing Japanese characters are logged. There might
  still be some errors if the Java application logs very long messages through
  the Wrapper, but in this case a special configuration is possible as a
  workaround.
* Fix a bug on FreeBSD 10.x where the libiconv library could not be loaded.
  This caused the Wrapper to stop at startup.
* Fix a scaling issue on the GUI of the Demo application. The main window was
  too small on high-DPI displays.

3.5.28
* Fix a memory leak on Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS and Amazon Linux AMI.
  It occurred when activating log rolling in size mode. This memory leak came
  from an issue in the GNU C Library (glibc) which was fixed on version 2.21.
  However, a workaround was added so that the Wrapper can run without issues
  on any version of glibc.
* Fix an issue on z/OS that if the path to the Wrapper binaries was longer 
  than 79 characters, the script could not execute the 'start' and 'stop' 
  commands properly. It reported a stale PID file when starting the daemonized
  process and later failed to stop it because it could not find that PID file.
* Fix the console flicker bug that was still happening when launching
  wrapperw.exe from a Windows shortcut.
* Add the possibility to configure Processor affinity for AIX, FreeBSD, HP-UX 
  and Solaris. For HP-UX and Solaris it is only possible to bind one CPU per
  process.
* Fix a problem where boolean configuration properties were not assigned their
  default values if a wrong value was set. The Wrapper always resolved unknown
  values to FALSE even though the default value should be TRUE.
* Add a new event 'WrapperSecondInvocationEvent' that can be consumed in the
  Java Application on Windows. This event will be fired whenever a second
  instance of the Wrapper tries to start when single invocation mode has
  been specified. This enables you to execute custom tasks like showing a
  message or bringing a window of your application to the front.
* With single invocation mode, it is now possible to specify that the Wrapper
  will focus the foreground window of the running Java Application instead of
  launching it a second time. If no window can be found, the focus will be set
  to the Wrapper monitoring the application. This can be used in combination
  with the event handling to activate any window that was brought to the front.
* Fix bug on Linux where RUN_AS_USER was ignored when running the Wrapper as
  a service controlled by systemd. The service was always running as root.
* Fix bug on AIX where running the Wrapper as a service would not use the
  System Resource Controller (SRC) and ignore RUN_AS_USER value.  Thanks to 
  Miroslaw for pointing this out and for his contributions to the shell script.
* Add a new bit flag (0x8000) to indicate that an error occurred when querying
  the status of a Windows service. If the query is silent (-qs option),
  wrapperw.exe will no longer display error messages in the dialogbox, but
  these errors will still be logged in the log file.
* Add new system property to WrapperStartStopApp (integration method #2) to
  handle passthrough parameters. These parameters can be passed to the start
  and/or stop method of your Java application. By default the passthrough
  parameters are ignored (see the javadocs of the WrapperStartStopApp class
  for details).
* On Windows, the Wrapper will now check that the code page of the console
  supports the specified language. If it doesn't, it will fall back to English.
* Add two new values for the wrapper.lang property: 'DESKTOP' and 'SYSTEM'.
  These values are used on Windows and ignored on other systems. The first,
  which is the default, specifies that the language of the Wrapper will be
  resolved according to the UI language. The second will cause it to use the
  system language. Before, the Wrapper used the language of the Region Format
  settings.
* Fix a bug where messages in Japanese coming from the JVM were badly encoded.
  This occurred on Windows when the language for non-unicode programs was not
  set to Japanese.
* Improve the error message if there are any problems initializing the backend
  pipe or socket.
* Add 'installstart' command to the UNIX shell script in order to install and
  then automatically start the Wrapper as a daemon process.
* On AIX and HPUX Itanium, the Wrapper will no longer have the GNU version of 
  libiconv as a dependency. This dependency was introduced in version 3.5.26
  for AIX and 3.5.27 for HPUX itanium, but caused some compatibility issues. 
* Add a new '--teardown' option (and TeardownApp.bat.in) to the Windows version 
  which can be used to reverse changes done with the '--setup' option. 
  Administrative credentials will be requested. As of version 3.5.28, this will 
  only unregister the application/service from the event log system. 
* Add a new property, wrapper.syslog.ident.enable, which tells the Wrapper to 
  create or delete an identification (also known as source) for the event log. 
  Starting with Windows Vista or Windows Server 2003, this action requires 
  administrative credentials. When running on a lower permission, the Wrapper 
  will ignore this property and start normally.
* Fix a bug where actions specified by wrapper.ping.timeout.action were only
  performed the first time the JVM became hung. All subsequent hangs were
  ignored. With the default configuration, this would mean the Wrapper could
  only restart a hung JVM once. Since 3.5.16.
* The Wrapper is now signed with a SHA-2 certificate. SHA-2 provides stronger
  security than the previously used SHA-1 algorithm. The decision to change the
  certificate was made in compliance with Microsoft's SHA-1 deprecation plan
  which states that Windows 7 and higher will no longer support SHA-1 after
  January 1st, 2016. It should be noted that Windows XP SP2 and lower, as well
  as Windows Server 2003, don't support SHA-2 and the new certificate will not
  apply on these platforms. The binaries provided for Windows Itanium will also
  no longer be signed.
* Fix memory errors happening on AIX when the system uses some localizations
  like Japanese.

3.5.27
* Fix a misleading error message when there is a problem processing a system
  error message on Windows.
* Handle system exit codes with descriptions (Windows only).  
* Add new configuration file directives (#properties.on_overwrite.loglevel and 
  #properties.on_overwrite.exit) to better control how the Wrapper should 
  behave when detecting duplicate property definitions.
* Fix: No longer tries to resume a Windows service that is already running, 
  or pause a service that is already paused.
* Improve accuracy of status messages when installing, removing, starting,
  stopping, resuming and pausing a Windows service.
* Improve the display of the available HostIds when calling 'wrapper -h'.
* Fix the console flicker bug. Happened when wrapper.ntservice.generate_console
  was set to TRUE, which is required for thread dumping.
* Fix a problem on Windows with the consoleless version of the Wrapper. If a 
  splash screen was set at launch time, and if the Wrapper eventually failed to
  start normally, the splash screen did not disappear and remained on the top 
  of the log window.
* Fix a problem on Windows platforms that caused the log window to overlap all 
  the other forms even when the focus was set on an other application.
* Add the ability to define CPU affinity for the Wrapper and JVM processes
  (Windows and Linux systems, professional edition).
* The wrapper can now be executed with a '--setup' option in order to install 
  components under elevated mode on Windows. During the installation, the 
  wrapper will register the application to the Windows Event Log system. 
  After the Wrapper is executed with the '--setup' option, the Event Viewer 
  will no longer report that the installation was corrupted.
* wrapper.exe and wrapper.dll are now manifested for compatibility with newer
  versions of Windows (8.1 and above).
* Modify the Community Edition license to allow the Wrapper to be integrated
  and distributed with Products released under either the GPL version 2 or GPL
  version 3 licenses.
* Include the PID of the Wrapper and Java processes in debug output.
* Fix a problem where the wrapper.jvm.port.min and wrapper.jvm.port.max
  properties were being ignored.  This meant that the defaults were always
  being used.  Since 3.5.26.
* Fix a very infrequent issue in which the Wrapper would produce an out of 
  memory error or fail when trying to get the path to the Wrapper on Windows 
  XP.
* Modify the wrapper.pausable and wrapper.pausable.stop_jvm properties so they
  are no longer reloaded when wrapper.restart.reload_configuration=TRUE.
* Fix a bug when the child process printing the JVM version became a zombie 
  after completion (problem known on CentOS). Add property 
  wrapper.java.version.timeout to let the user set a timeout for the child 
  process to print the JVM version before being terminated.
* Avoid 4227 events in the Windows LogBook when using SOCKET values for the
  wrapper.backend.type property.  We now try to check the port status in
  native code prior to opening it in Java.  The Wrapper worked correctly, but
  a Windows issue was causing warnings in the EventLog if the port had an
  existing socket in the TIME_WAIT state from a previous JVM invocation.
* Fix a problem on AIX with OpenJRE where the Wrapper failed to load the
  native library. The native library now has a '.so' extension like on other 
  UNIX platforms.
* Fix a problem on HP-UX when listing HostIds. If several HostIds were 
  available on the machine, the Wrapper could only get the first one and 
  reported DLPI errors when attempting to get the others.
* Fix path to remove files when uninstalling the Wrapper daemon process on 
  HPUX.
* Added Linux Itanium binaries in the "Delta Pack". It was removed since 
  version 3.5.18.
* Fix an encoding conversion error when sending email on HP-UX.
* On MacOSX, set the launchd KeepAlive key to "false" by default as 
  recommended by Apple. However, it is possible to set it to "true" by editing 
  the new MACOSX_KEEP_RUNNING variable in the script file.
  
3.5.26
* Improve the log messages when a JVM restart is requested when the Wrapper is
  in a state that it will be ignored.
* (Standard, Professional) Add an additional debug message when a deadlock
  sweep completes.  No functional change but this was added to make it easy to
  tell how long the sweep takes on a given application.
* Clean up the internal tracking of where environment variables were set.
  No functional changes.
* When detecting Cygwin with 'uname -o' in the script file, some OS's
  (Solaris, MacOS, etc.) show an error message because '-o' is not a valid
  parameter.  Now we hide this error message to avoid confusion and we can
  guess that Cygwin is not running.
* Add the ability to control the service with systemd using the script file.
* On Mac OS X, fix a typo, add another alternative way to find Java to set
  the JAVA_HOME environment variable, and use the full path to execute sysctl
  in case it's not in the path. Thanks to Dannes Wessels for pointing this
  out.
* Fix a problem on newer versions of Windows when customizing the Wrapper. 
  The certificate was not removed when creating the target. This was leading
  to an error when trying to sign the target with a new certificate.
* Add missing support in the shell script for restarting/stopping the Wrapper 
  service with launchctl on Mac OS X.
* Add missing support in the shell script for restarting/stopping the Wrapper 
  service with Upstart.
* Add the ability to set the path of the 'su' command as well as the ability
  to specify additional arguments in the Wrapper shell script using new SU_BIN
  and SU_OPTS variables.
* Fix a problem in the WrapperSimpleApp, WrapperStartStopApp, and
  WrapperJarApp helper classes where command line problems that resulted in
  the JVM exiting on startup looked like unexpected exits.  This meant that
  the Wrapper would try to relaunch the JVM again rather than giving up on the
  first attempt.
* Modified the WrapperSimpleApp, WrapperStartStopApp, and WrapperJarApp helper
  classes so that their usage banners will only now be shown for command line
  related problems.  Issues with the specified classes, methods, or jar files
  are still logged as errors, but showing the user the usage in these cases
  was confusing.
* Correct the WrapperResources.getString() method that has no replacement
  arguments so that its processing of the raw string is handled the same as
  methods which have replacement arguments.  Now all strings are processed
  by the MessageFormat class before being returned.  Previous versions were
  not consistent about the need to escape single quotes.
* Added optional key validation to make sure that strings passed in to the
  WrapperResources.getString() method are formatted correctly.  See the
  WrapperResources class for information how to enable.
* Clean up escaping of single quotes in a few messages.
* Add new options for property wrapper.backend.type: AUTO, SOCKET,
  SOCKET_IPv4, SOCKET_IPv6, PIPE. When set to AUTO, the Wrapper will try to
  open a socket ipv4 and fallback to ipv6 and to pipe in case of error.
* Fix bug when converting from multibyte to wide char without setting the
  locale at startup (Unix only). Thanks to Bert.
* Add a 'CLOSE_BACKEND' alias to 'CLOSE_SOCKET' as a test command for the
  wrapper.commandfile property.  This is because there have been multiple
  options for the backend connection for some time and the name is more
  portable.
* Fix a problem on Mac when running OS X Yosemite where the script was failing
  to correctly compare versions '10.10' to '10.5.0'.  This was leading to the
  script thinking that only 32-bit binaries could be run.  This was only an
  issue if the delta pack naming of the wrapper binaries was being used.
* Add a new wrapper.java.classpath.missing.loglevel property which makes it
  possible to control how the Wrapper logs warnings about missing classpath
  elements.  Previously this was always logged as debug output and could not
  be disabled.
* If there are any low level problems launching the Java process that are not
  related to configuration or the JVM itself, the Wrapper will no longer try
  again as such retries were meaningless.
* Windows system APIs have a problem that cause a process to crash if it
  attempts to set an environment variable over 32767 characters in length.
  The Wrapper now checks for this and logs an error rather than setting the
  variable.  This was a problem if very large classpaths were used when the
  wrapper.java.classpath.use_environment property was TRUE.
* Windows does not allow a command line to be longer than 32766 characters in
  length.  Different versions of Windows handle it differently when such a
  long command is provided.  The Wrapper now does its own check and shows an
  error in a consistent way.
* Improve the error message on UNIX platforms when the command line is longer
  than the system maximum.  This maximum varies greatly by platform and
  environment and is difficult to calculate reliably, so the maximum length
  is not currently shown in the message.
* Fix a problem on UNIX platforms where a very large configuration file could
  cause the WrapperManager to fail to startup.  This was caused by the partial
  transfer of the configuration file to the WrapperManager via the backend
  connection.  This would happen regardless of the backend type used.  The
  size of the configuration file that would cause a problem varied greatly
  based on the specific system.
* Fix a problem on Windows platforms where a very large configuration file
  would fail to be sent to the WrapperManager on startup when the
  wrapper.backend.type property was set to PIPE.  The only problem was that
  the WrapperManager.getProperties() method would be empty.
* (Professional) Add checks to the WrapperManager.exec() methods on Windows
  for the maximum command line length of 32766, and maximum environment
  variable name-value pair length of 32767.
* (Professional) Fix a problem where a free of a NULL pointer was being done
  as part of the cleanup process of a WrapperManager.exec() call.  This is not
  known to have caused any issues.
* Added getStdOut(), getStdErr(), and getStdIn() methods to the WrapperProcess
  class as aliases to the getInputStream(), getErrorStream(), and
  getOutputStream() methods to help avoid confusion.
* Fix a problem on Windows 7 where long log lines got corrupted after 31397
  characters when wrapper.console.direct was true.  This seems to be a problem
  with the underlying Windows API and was only a display issue.  Reduced the
  maximum number of characters that can be written with a single API call to
  30000 to work around the issue.  This change is internal and there is still
  no limit on the length of logged lines.
* Fix a deadlock if the Wrapper failed to write to the backend when the
  wrapper.backend.type property was PIPE.  Found by code review and is not
  known to have actually happened.
* From Mac OSX 10.5.0, the script file will use the key 'KeepAlive' in the 
  launchctl configuration file. Prior versions of Mac OSX will continue to use
  the same key 'OnDemand'. Thanks to Robin for pointing this out.
* (Standard, Professional) Disallow the use of hostids tied to Apple Bluetooth
  devices when running on a virtualized Windows system hosted on an OS X
  system.
* Fix a problem where WrapperManager.log() was not working correctly when
  multi-byte messages were logged.
* In the debug output the full configuration properties packet is suppressed
  from the log output because it is huge and can contain sensitive data.
  Add a size to the abbreviated output to assist with debugging.
* Fix a memory leak on UNIX platforms whenever an error message was reported.
  This was only a problem if the message was logged repeatedly.
* Correct a couple other potential memory leaks found through code review.
  Not known to have been causing any actual problems.
  
3.5.25
* (Professional) Improve the wrapper.timer.<n>.interval property so it is now
  possible to specify ranges and lists of values as well as offsets for
  interval values to more precisely control when timers are fired.
* (Professional) Fix a problem with the wrapper.timer.<n>.interval property
  where timers would not fire during an interval the system time was set back.
  Also fixed a problem where timers would stop firing permanently if the
  system time was set forward by more than the value of the
  wrapper.timer.max_catchup property and a timer had been scheduled to be
  fired during that interval.  Both of these issues were most likely during
  daylight savings time.
* Fix a problem where signals received by the JVM were not being logged in
  debug output correctly if the wrapper.ignore_signals property is set to
  true.  We now also log debug output even if a user event listener consumes
  the signal event.
* Fix a problem on Gentoo Linux where the shell script was not correctly
  detecting the system architecture.  This may also be a problem on other
  distributions whose 'uname -p' returns a detailed architecture.
* In the shell script, when the flag to use systemd (USE_SYSTEMD) is set,
  the shell script generates a ".service" file in /etc/systemd/system/
  when installing the Wrapper as a daemon.
* In the shell script, add a function to validate the size of APP_NAME when
  installing or removing the daemon on AIX.
* It was possible to disable the logging of the Java command line even when
  debug output was enabled by setting the wrapper.java.command.loglevel
  property to NONE.  This made it difficult to debug problems and is no longer
  possible.
* When the wrapper.java.version.output property is set to true, add debug log
  output to show the actual command line used.
* Fix a problem on Windows when the wrapper.java.version.output property is
  true where it was possible that java executable being run to get the version
  could be different than that used to run the application if the java
  executable was being located on the default system PATH as well as the PATH
  defined in the environment.  The Wrapper now looks once and uses the same
  fully resolved path in both places. For clarity, both java command lines are
  now included in debug log output when the version is requested. (Bug #288)
* Change the timing of the logging of the Java command line on UNIX so it is
  consistent with Windows.
* Improve the error message text thrown when a native feature is not available
  from Java to be more clear about whether the problem is that the native
  library could not be loaded versus the wrong edition being used.
* On Windows, detect when the Wrapper is running under Cygwin and set the 
  default value for wrapper.console.flush to TRUE. On other platforms, 
  the script will display a message and stop running.
* (Professional) Add support for WRAPPER_EVENT_TIME_* and WRAPPER_EVENT_RAND_*
  variable references so event times can be used when events are fired.
* Fix a buffer overflow problem on AIX which caused crashes or deadlocks on
  startup for some users.  This had been an issue since 3.5.0 but only reported
  recently.
* Remove output debug messages on UNIX when the wrapper.port.address property
  was set.
* Clean up code when converting multibyte characters to wide characters. Some 
  error checks were not implemented correctly. Found during a code review and
  is not known to have actually caused any problems.

3.5.24
* Fix a problem where the message source of remote syslog messages from the JVM
  were being logged as "jvm %d" rather than "jvm 1".
* Add a new wrapper.syslog.split_messages property which controls whether or
  not multi-line messages will be logged as is or first split into individual
  lines.
* Fix a problem on Windows Vista and above where the wrapper.single_invocation
  property was not correctly identifying Wrapper instances running in different
  sessions under some circumstances.

3.5.23
* Clean up the error messages logged when the Wrapper failed to elevate itself
  on Windows platforms.  They are now more informative.
* (Professional) Fix a handle leak on Windows in WrapperProcess.isAlive().
* (Professional) Modify the exception thrown when WrapperManager.exec is called
  while the Wrapper is shutdown so it now says that rather than saying that the
  native library is not loaded.
* (Processional) The Wrapper is now more careful to make sure that the backend
  is never closed while a child process is being launched to ensure that the
  Wrapper knows about all child processes launched.
* (Professional) Add a warning message in case the Wrapper is not notified of
  a launched child process due to the backend connection being closed.
* (Professional) Fix a potential NPE that could be thrown while reading stdout
  or stderr output from a child process while the Wrapper was shutting down and
  after the child process exited.
* (Professional) Fix a problem on UNIX platforms where we were getting stuck
  trying to cleanup after a process which was currently blocking on a read from
  stdout or stderr.
* (Professional) Fix a problem on UNIX platforms where a timeout attempting to
  obtain an internal lock of the child process list was causing an internal
  counter to get out of sync, leading to a other terminated child processes
  being left as defunct zombies until the Java process terminated.
* (Professional) Fix a problem on UNIX platforms where pipe file descriptions
  used to communicate with child processes were being incorrectly passed to all
  child processes.  They were not growing over time.
* (Professional) Fix a potential synchronization problem calling
  WrapperProcess.waitFor() or WrapperProcess.exitValue().
* Add additional debug log output showing the various timeout values to help
  with debugging user issues.
* Fix a problem where the shell script was not correctly detecting the OS
  version with Mac OSX Maverick.
* Add warnings about undefined environment variables in include file references
  in the configuration file.
* Add support for environment variable expansion in files specified with the
  wrapper.java.additional_file and wrapper.app.parameter_file properties.
* Correct the integer formatting in the WrapperUNIXGroup.toString() method so
  it is consistent with the rest of the Wrapper.
* Fix a problem where the iconv library requirement couldn't be satisfied in 
  FreeBSD 10.  We now locate the library dynamically by looking for
  /usr/local/lib/libiconv.so, /usr/local/lib/libbiconv.so, or
  /lib/libkiconv.so.4 in that order.
* Fix a the WrapperPrintStream.println method so strings containing linefeeds
  will correctly have each line prepended with the configured header.
* (Standard, Professional) When an unknown license type is encountered, include
  the unknown type in the error message to help with debugging.
* (Standard, Professional) Fix a problem on FreeBSD systems where the
  wrapper.lang.encoding was not resolving to UTF-8 correctly when the LANG
  environment variable was not set.
* (Professional) Fix a memory corruption problem on z/OS when the language was
  set to a double byte locale like Japanese.
* Go through and make the Wrapper much more durable when badly encoded double
  byte characters are encountered.

3.5.22
* (Standard, Professional) Fix a crash in native code behind WrapperResources
  instances which could happen if the system was very low on memory. Since
  version 3.5.7.
* (Professional) Fix a couple slow memory leaks in the native code involved
  with launching and checking on the status of child processes.
* (Professional) Fix a problem where an attempt to throw a WrapperJNIError
  within native code on Z/OS would result in a ClassNotFoundException being
  thrown.
* Reviewed the native JNI code and fixed a few potential crashes and memory
  leaks which could occur under low memory conditions.
* Modify the way the wrapper.console.direct property works so the Wrapper will
  now always downgrade itself to using piped console writing as soon as it has
  determined that a physical console does not exist.  In 3.5.21 we tried to
  predict when the console would not exist and disabling it in advance.  There
  were cases where this was not correct, resulting in error messages in the
  console output.
* Fix a problem where operations like installing a service on Windows 7 and
  above which need to be elevated were resulting in an error that the Wrapper
  could not write to the console.  The actual operation was working correctly
  but the console output was incorrect.  Since 3.5.21.
* Move the check that the jar and wrapper versions match earlier in the startup
  process so we guarantee that a warning will always be displayed.  There were
  some errors which could abort the startup process before this warning was
  logged.
* (Standard, Professional) Fix a problem where the value of wrapper.lang.folder
  was not being recognized if a wrapper.lang value was not set.
* (Standard, Professional) Fix a small memory leak resolving the language to
  run the Wrapper with.
* (Professional) Fix a potential buffer overflow reading data from a child
  process stderr or stdout if the amount of data available in the pipe is
  larger than the buffer length passed in to WrapperProcessInputStream.
  read(byte b[], int off, int len).
* (Professional) Fix a problem where reads from a WrapperProcessInputStream
  were consuming too much CPU while blocking for data on Windows.  Now
  correctly being done asynchronously.
* (Professional) Fix a problem where JVM cleanup, including cleanup of child
  processes, was not always being done completely if the user requested an
  immediate shutdown by pressing CTRL-C twice.

3.5.21
* Add a new 'R' log format which will track the number of milliseconds since
  the previous JVM log output.  Useful for simple performance checks.  See
  the wrapper.console.format, wrapper.event.default.email.maillog.format,
  wrapper.logdialog.format, and wrapper.logfile.format properties.
* When the ACCESS_VIOLATION testing command of the wrapper.commandfile was used
  to kill the Wrapper some log output was not making it into the wrapper.log
  file.  Add a forced flush just before crashing the Wrapper to make sure
  everything makes it into the log file.
* Add a new wrapper.javaio.buffer_size property which makes it possible to
  control the size of the internal buffer used to process console output from
  the JVM.  Also increased the default from the system default to 65536 bytes.
* Renamed the wrapper.use_javaio_thread property to wrapper.javaio.use_thread.
  The old property still exists as a deprecated alias.
* Added a new wrapper.console.direct property on Windows which tells the
  Wrapper to use Windows APIs to render log output to the console rather than
  writing to stdout and stderr.  This results in a major speed improvement.
  The drawback is that this removes the ability to pipe the output to another
  program on the command line.  We chose to enable this by default so the
  majority of users can take advantage of the speed improvement.  If your
  application takes advantage of piping on Windows, you will need to disable
  this property to regain the old behavior.
* Add a new "wrapperm" logging source on Windows to help differentiate which
  log entries are coming from Wrapper invocations used to control the Wrapper
  as a service such as starting, stopping, installing, etc.  Previously the
  log entries from the Wrapper service process and launching process both
  used a "wrapper" logging source, which could be confusing.
* On UNIX, modify the way we keep track of whether the process is daemonized or
  not.  This was done to clean up a bit, but should not effect how the Wrapper
  works.
* On Windows, change the timing of when PID files are created when running as
  a service so any failures creating them will correctly be reported as a
  service error.  If the Wrapper was unable to write to a PID file because it
  was read-only then the user was presented with a confusing message about
  the service timing out on startup.  This was in addition to the correct
  error being logged.
* Fix a potential problem where internally queued log entries could fail to be
  logged on shutdown.  The log queue is now always processed as part of the
  shutdown process.
* Modify UNIX shell script to remove all existing run level rc files for the
  application on both install and remove, rather than only the ones for the
  currently configured run level to avoid unexpected behavior due to old rc
  files being left around.  This only affects platforms which make use of
  rc files.
* Add a new RUN_LEVEL variable to the UNIX shell script to make it easy to
  configure the run levels when installing as a daemon on various platforms.
* Add new wrapper.logfile.close.timeout and wrapper.logfile.flush.timeout
  properties, and deprecate the wrapper.logfile.inactivity.timeout property,
  to increase control over when and how the logfile is flushed and closed.
* Add a new PIDFILE_CHECK_PID setting in the UNIX shell script which makes it
  possible to control whether or not the script double checks that the pid in
  an existing pidfile is actually the pid of the application's Wrapper.  This
  property makes it possible to disable this check so multiple applications
  can be tied to the same pid file.
* Go through and make sure that none of the Wrapper native JNI methods are
  called after the WrapperManager shutdown has completed.  Doing so was causing
  a JVM crash on some Linux JVMs.  This was happening when a WrapperResources
  instance was finalized by the garbage collector on shutdown.
* (Professional) Fix a problem where processes created by calling the
  WrapperManager.exec functions could fail to be registered with the Wrapper
  for cleanup if the call was made as the JVM was shutting down.  This was
  resolved by making sure that JNI calls can not be called after the
  WrapperManager shutdown has completed.
* Modify the internal WrapperManager tick thread so it is allowed to complete
  once the WrapperManager has fully shutdown.  This was the only remaining
  reference to the WrapperManager class.
* Add a new wrapper.property_warning.loglevel property which controls the log
  level at which the Wrapper will log warnings about undefined but referenced
  environment variables, as well as invalid boolean or integer values.
* Update the way environment variable references within property values are
  parsed to make it possible to report those which are not defined.  Each pair
  of '%'s is now expected to be part of a variable reference.  For example
  "%AAA%BBB%CCC%", previously if "AAA" was not defined, "BBB" would be located,
  but now only "AAA" and "CCC" will be recognized as variables.
* Fix a problem on Windows where a non-existent wrapper.working.dir directory
  was causing multiple error messages in the log file.
* Modify the way the wrapper.environment.dump property works so it will now
  log at the INFO level with the rest of Wrapper output when set to true.
  When false however, the output will be logged as DEBUG output if enabled.
  Previous versions always logged the output to the INFO log level in either
  case.
* Fix a problem on Linux IA64 where the WrapperActionServer was throwing an
  IOException when the JVM was shutdown by calling System.exit.  It did not
  cause any problems other than the message in the log.
* (Professional) Added new "jvm_ping_timeout", "jvm_ping_slow", and
  "jvm_ping_response_slow" events to help respond to ping related issues.
* Fix a problem where a value of 0 for wrapper.ping.alert.threshold was not
  correctly disabling ping threshold alerts.
* (Professional) Fix a problem where the thread that handles events would
  permanently get stuck if the event queue filled up.  This was very unlikely
  but not impossible if a large number of filter events were triggered in a
  very short time.  Corrected the problem so it now recovers correctly, but
  also increased the queue size to make the overflow even more unlikely.
* (Standard, Professional) Fix a problem where console output of a wrapperw.exe
  processes launched when the wrapper.ntservice.console property was TRUE was
  not being shown correctly. This issue was introduced in 3.5.19.

3.5.20
* Further improvements to the memory footprint of the Wrapper to minimize the
  memory required when logging JVM output consisting of very long lines.
* Fix a minor potential buffer overflow, which could occur if the path of the
  first classpath element is larger than 1024 characters. This overflow was
  detected during a code review and we have no reports that it actually ever
  caused any problems.
* Improve the error message displayed when the Wrapper's configuration file
  could not be loaded so that it now includes the name of the file.
* Work around a libc system library bug on some HPUX platforms in which calls
  to vswprintf can cause a crash if the expanded string does not fit into the
  buffer.  Worked around the problem with the help of HP support by making sure
  the buffer length followed a rule so that its length was 1+N where N is a
  multiple of 8.
* Fix a problem on HPUX platforms where the JVM would sometimes get stuck on
  shutdown, when the shutdown was initiated within the JVM, leading to the
  Wrapper having to forcibly kill it.  This was caused by the Wrapper
  attempting to close the backend socket when another read was blocking
  attempting to read from the same socket.  This was introduced in version
  3.5.8.
* Fix a potential log corruption when queued log messages were larger than the
  internal buffer size.  Found during a code review and is not known to have
  actually caused any problems.
* Fix a typo in the shell script which was breaking the 'install' command on
  Solaris platforms.
* Fix a potential crash on HPUX platforms if the value of the
  wrapper.port.address property had an encoding problem.

3.5.19
* Fix a problem in the batch file, where a space in the path to the Wrapper.exe
  file would cause the script to locate the Wrapper.exe file. Introduced in
  3.5.18.
* When running as Windows service with hiding the console of the Wrapper will
  cause the Wrapper to disable unnecessary logging to the console in order
  to enhance performance.

3.5.18
* Fix a problem, where an unclosed percentage character '%' was opening the
  chance of a dangling pointer in the additional java parameters. The '%'
  character is a special character, specifying an environment variable.
* Added variable _WRAPPER_DIR the batch files to make it possible to specify
  any other directory where the Wrapper binary file is located. Until now the
  batch file and exe file had to be in the same location. Thanks and credits
  go to Geoff.
* Added property wrapper.port.address, which makes it possible to specify a
  different address to bind the socket to when using the socket backend
  connection between the Wrapper and the JVM. Until now, the socket was
  always bound to the localhost loopback interface.
* The script will from now on also use the update-rc.d tool for installing
  an application as daemon on Debian. Thanks and credits go to Haifeng.
* Whenever the Wrapper is causing the JVM to be forcibly terminated, the
  Wrapper will make sure the JVM has actually been terminated. If it wasn't
  after wrapper.jvm_terminate.timeout seconds, a pending restart will be
  canceled and the Wrapper exit.
* Reworked the way the Wrapper is processing output from the JVM, in order
  to increase performance on huge output on a single line and also reduce
  memory usage.

3.5.17
* Add a new wrapper.java.additional.default.stripquotes property to make it
  possible to specify the default value of
  wrapper.java.additional.<n>.stripquotes
* Fix a bug where the timer failed to calculate the fire time when that time
  was more than one week in the future.  This was possible for weekly timers
  which spanned a daylight savings time change which rolled the time back by
  an hour in the fall.
* Fix problem in the shell script, where it might fail to remove an installed
  daemon after the location of the script has been changed.
* Add additional advice messages when a Windows service fails to be started
  due to file access problems involving the Wrapper binary, configuration, or
  log files.
* Fix a problem where the dynamic library on MacOSX was not able to load it's
  functions.
* Added wrapper.app.parameter_file property, which works similar to the
  wrapper.java.additional_file property
* Reduce CPU-consumption of WrapperProcess.waitFor() function

3.5.16
* (Standard, Professional) Retry failed share mappings if the target host or
  network is unreachable as that may be a temporary problem.
* (Professional) There was a problem where the IO-redirection of a child
  process which got created with the WrapperManager.exec API and used the
  feature to run the child process in the logged on users desktop was
  only allowing to create a process once per second.
* Include information about the base configuration file in the debug output
  when debugging of cascading configuration files has been enabled.
* Add a check in the UNIX script to output a more descriptive error message,
  when the user specified in the RUN_AS_USER variable doesn't exist.
* (Standard, Professional) Fix a problem where console log output was not being
  displayed correctly when running with the WrapperW.exe binary with the
  wrapper.ntservice.console property was set to true.
* (Standard, Professional) Implement the wrapper.ntservice.generate_console
  property when using the WrapperW.exe binary so it is now possible to disable
  the creation of the hidden console.
* Modify the way the wrapper.ntservice.generate_console property works so
  it is now easier to disable the generation of the console using just this
  property.
* Improve the message logged when the Wrapper attempts to perform a thread
  dump without a valid console being available.
* Add new wrapper.ping.alert.threshold and wrapper.ping.alert.loglevel
  properties which make it much easier to debug ping timeout issues by asking
  the Wrapper to log messages about ping responses which were shorter than the
  registered wrapper.ping.timeout, but longer than the threshold.
* Add a new WrapperManager.appearSlow method which makes it easier to test
  how the Wrapper behaves when the JVM is being slow to respond to commands.
* Add a new wrapper.disable_tests property which can be used to disable all of
  the testing methods of the WrapperManager class.  It has always been possible
  to control their access with a SecurityManager, but this is simpler for most
  applications.
* Update the default wrapper configuration file template so a restart due to a
  matched OutOfMemoryError filter will no longer be triggered by default if the
  user enables -verbose:class output.
* Fix a problem on UNIX platforms where the Wrapper would fail to start if it
  was located on the system PATH.  This had been a problem since version 3.3.0
  but had gone unnoticed as the Wrapper is not usually referenced in this way.
* Rework the internal flags governing the generation and hiding of the backend
  console on Windows so we are able to almost always obtain the console's
  window handle.
* Cleanup some startup code to reduce duplication and make sure that more debug
  and warning messages are logged after the "Wrapper Started" message.
* Add new wrapper.java.additional_file and
  wrapper.java.additional_file.stripquotes properties to make it possible to
  specify JVM parameters in a file.
* Add support for Linux on ARM systems.
* Re-Enabled the forced reloading of the SYSTEM (and if set to a specific
  account, the user) registry before launching the Wrapper as a service on
  Windows XP and 2003. This has been originally disabled for Windows XP and
  2003 since version 3.5.5.
* (Standard, Professional) Fix a problem where the instance class names logged
  when a deadlock involving ReentrantLock instances were corrupted.  The actual
  deadlock detection was working correctly, but this could have lead to other
  problems caused by the corruption.  A workaround was to set the
  wrapper.check.deadlock.output property to SIMPLE.
* (Standard, Professional) Make it possible to completely disable the details
  of a deadlock by setting the wrapper.check.deadlock.output property to NONE.
* (Standard, Professional) Object Ids in thread dump reports were not correctly
  being logged as 64-bit ids on 64-bit JVMs in some cases.
* Fix a problem where the source code values returned by the
  WrapperServiceActionEvent.getSourceCode() method were incorrect.  The
  constant values were incorrect and have been corrected from this release.
* Add new WrapperServiceActionEvent.getSourceCodeName() and
  WrapperServiceActionEvent.getSourceCodeName(int actionSourceCode) methods
  which returns a localized name of the source where the event originated.
* Fix a minor problem where a couple uncommon backend packet codes were not
  being correctly identified by name in the debug log output.  Functionally
  they were all working correctly.
* Added property wrapper.ping.timeout.action, which will let you specify an
  action in case the timeout triggers. So far the only action was to restart
  the JVM. 
* Fix a problem where a JVM process was not stopped completely on a UNIX 
  platform and stayed defunct after a forced kill until the Wrapper process
  itself stopped. This was especially noticeable if the JVM is frozen and the
  JVM is being killed forcibly.
* Add additional debug log output showing the various timeout values to help
  with debugging user issues.

3.5.15
* Add a new _WRAPPER_CONF_OVERRIDE setting to the Wrapper dedicated command
  batch files on Windows so it is now possible to control whether or not the
  first parameter is the configuration file name.  The ability to specify an
  alternate configuration file is now disabled by default as it was confusing
  for users who tried to pass other parameters to the JVM.
* Correct a couple log messages in the WrapperManager class which were missing
  the correct prefix identifying where they originated.
* Remove some old reflection code needed for Java 1.2.x support as we have
  required Java 1.4 since version 3.4.0.
* Remove some code to try to reconnect the backend socket from Java.  It has
  never been possible to do so without restarting the JVM, and the related
  messages were confusing.
* Add a new wrapper.disable_forced_shutdown property to make it possible to
  disable the feature to forcibly kill the JVM on shutdown if CTRL-C was
  pressed twice.
* Reduce the number of times thread priorities are changed within the
  WrapperManager class to simplify the startup and shutdown process.
* Fixed a dangling pointer problem, which could cause undefined behaviour
  whenever a property contained an unset environment variable.
* Fix a race condition in the timer thread, which could cause a sigkill 
  being propagated through the whole process group rather than the timer 
  thread. This can only happen during the shutdown of the Wrapper. 
* When a child process, which got launched by WrapperManager.exec()
  failed to start due to a runtime-error (such as missing privileges), the 
  forked heap persisted and the child process never finished until 
  shutdown/restart of the JVM. The error only appears on Unix platforms
  when using the FORK_EXEC start-type.
* Change log level and message if a certificate check returned a problem, 
  which is not directly caused by the signature of the Wrapper, but the 
  signature chain. 
* Fix a problem when the silent query command wasn't returning the correct
  exit code on windows Vista (and later) when the command was run from an
  unelevated console. Thanks to Darren for pointing this out. 
* The java system property wrapper.backend.so_timeout was ignored if it 
  was set to 0, making it not possible to explicitly set the timeout to 
  be indefinitely.
* Added the properties wrapper.java.additional.auto_bits.<platform> to 
  individually turn on/off the feature for the supported platforms.
* Fix a problem where the script was trying to use the 64-bit binaries on
  Mac OSX even if the CPU was only a 32-bit architecture. This only affected
  versions of Mac OSX greater 10.5.0, the vast majority of those machines are 
  already 64-bit CPU's. 
* The Wrapper when reloading the configuration file, was trying to access
  data from the call stack of a function which was actually outside of the
  memory range of the stack. This access violation might yield a segmentation
  fault. This issue was introduced in 3.5.5. Thanks to Lincoln for helping
  finding this problem.
  
3.5.14
* Fix a problem in the AppCommand.bat.in file where a parenthesis in the
  file name of the Wrapper binary would have caused a 
  "PATH was unexpected at this time" error.
* (Standard, Professional) Fix a problem when using a localized version of
  the Wrapper on Windows 64-bit platforms where the Wrapper would continue
  to use the default system language even wrapper.lang was used to specify
  a different language.  Introduced in 3.5.12.
* Fix a problem in the Windows AppCommand.bat.in command based batch file
  where the 'status' command was incorrectly being reported as 'query' in the
  usage output.  The 'status' command had always worked correctly if used.
* Fix a problem on UNIX platforms where some asynchronous messages were
  causing a warning message "Coding Error..." to be logged in place of the
  intended message.  This could be seen if the configured log file did not
  have write permissions.  Other than the incorrect log message, the Wrapper
  worked correctly.  Introduced in 3.5.2.
* Fix a problem in the UNIX script where running with Upstart wasn't working
  correctly when RUN_AS_USER was set.
* Relax security checks when running the 'status' command against the UNIX
  shell script so it now allows any user running the script to perform the
  read-only check of the pid file.
* Fix a problem with the UNIX script where the 'remove' command was trying to
  stop a running application even when the application had not been installed.
* Fix a buffer overflow which could potentially cause a crash during the
  installation of a Windows Service when wrapper.ntservice.account was
  specified.  This was introduced in 3.5.12.
* Fix a heap corruption which could occur on startup and potentially cause a
  crash. Only Windows systems, which use the System Event logs, were affected.
  Discovered from a code review, there had never been any reports of this
  causing problems for users.  This could happen if the configured wrapper.log
  could not be written to as the Wrapper always tries to write to the Event
  Log in such cases.  Introduced in 3.5.12.
* Add a new version comparison between the UNIX shell script and Wrapper to
  start showing a warning in case of a version mismatch.  The check will only
  work if the shell script and Wrapper are each of at least version 3.5.14.
* Added a new wrapper.pidfile.strict property which will tell the Wrapper not
  to start if the pid file already existed.  Defaults to false for backwards
  compatibility.
* Make the Java side of the backend socket more resilient in case of a read
  or write timeout.  The backend socket does not have a timeout set by default
  so this should not have been an issue.  A couple users reported problems on
  specific systems however which led to this fix.
* To aid in the testing of the backend socket timeout, a new
  wrapper.backend.so_timeout system property was added to make it possible to
  configure the backend socket to use a timeout.  See the Javadocs of the
  WrapperManager class for details.

3.5.13
* Fix a typo in the script where the environment variable 'TR_BIN' should 
  actually be 'TREXE'.  This was causing the "install" command on UNIX
  platforms to fail.   Introduced in 3.5.12.
* Fix a heap corruption which could lead to a crash that would occur the
  second time an internal buffer used for logging was expanded.  The buffer
  would be expanded the first time a log line over 2048 characters in length
  was encountered.   Then the second expansion would happen when a line at
  least 1024 characters longer was encountered.  Introduced in 3.5.11.
  Bug ID #3423108

3.5.12
* Put more descriptive Text in case the Wrapper is using integration method 4, 
  but the jar file deos not specify the Main-Class correctly in its meta 
  information.
* Fix a bug when failing to grant the LogOnAsService permission to a domain
  user.
* Fix a bug where the ident for the syslog on Unix platforms was broken since 
  3.5.0.  This was because when opening the syslog, the Wrapper was freeing the
  memory for pointing to ident. However the string pointer ident will be
  retained internally by the Syslog routines. And must not free the memory that
  ident points to.  Bug #3404978.
* Add a check on the script to make sure the 'tr' command exists on Unix
  platforms.
* Improve the parsing of log formats so that format tokens are recocognized
  even if they are lower case.  This affects the wrapper.console.format,
  wrapper.event.default.email.maillog.format, wrapper.logdialog.format, and
  wrapper.logfile.format properties.
* The Wrapper parses log formats by looking for known tokens, any invalid
  tokens are simply ignored.  If the entire format is made up of invalid tokens
  then this resulted in the Wrapper logging an empty line, which was not very
  useful and caused confusion when encountered.  The Wrapper now reverts to the
  default log format in such cases.  This affects the wrapper.console.format,
  wrapper.event.default.email.maillog.format, wrapper.logdialog.format, and
  wrapper.logfile.format properties.
* Improve the debug output while loading native libraries to avoid confusion
  about the meaning of the warning logged about attempts to load alternately
  named native library files.
* Fix a problem on Unix platforms where the default umask was being set to 0000
  rather than inheriting it from the parent process when running as a daemon
  process.  This can be a security problem as log and other files have global
  read/write access.  Introduced in 3.5.8.  Can be worked around by setting
  the wrapper.umask property to a safe value.

3.5.11
* Fix a potential crash on Windows caused by a buffer overflow.  This has been
  a problem since version 3.5.0 and affects configurations which define more
  than one wrapper.ntservice.dependency.<n>.  Depending on what was in memory,
  this did not always result in a crash.  It has very reproducible behavior for
  a given configuration file.
* Fix a problem on Windows where the Wrapper was taking 15 seconds or longer to
  startup on some systems because the WinVerifyTrust system call was having
  problems updating the CRL.  This had been a problem since the Wrapper
  binaries started being signed in version 3.5.7.  If the WinVerifyTrust call
  takes longer than the configured wrapper.startup_thread.timeout then the
  Wrapper will continue to startup without further delay.
* (Standard, Professional) Explicitly remove the certificate of the customized
  binary during customization. There were problems resigning the binary with
  another certificate otherwise.
* If the Wrapper is unable to write to the configured wrapper.logfile for any
  reason then we always fall back to a default log file and then log a message
  about the failure.  If the default also fails then that is also logged but
  the messages would only be logged to the console in most cases.  Modify the
  Wrapper so we now always send both messages to the syslog or EventLog
  regardless of what the wrapper.syslog.loglevel is set to.  This is important
  to help track down the cause of logfile access problems.
* Starting with version 3.5.0, it was internally possible to print out
  multi-line log messages so that all of the lines would always be grouped
  together in the log file.  This version modifies the logging code slightly so
  that such multi-line log output is now logged as a single message in the UNIX
  sylog or Windows EventLog.
* Fix a problem where very long lines of output from the JVM would cause the
  Wrapper to appear to hang for a while.  The first time a single line of
  output containing several hundred thousand characters was logged, an internal
  buffer was being incrementally increased by 100 characters per cycle.  The
  Wrapper now increases the size based on last known size to greatly reduce the
  number of cycles needed to choose a new buffer size.
* Modify the PAUSE_THREAD command so it is now possible to wait indefinitely.
  Only useful for testing the Wrapper.
* Add a new PAUSE_LOGGER command to make it possible to pause the next log
  entry.  Only useful for testing the Wrapper.
* On UNIX, the stdout/stderr pipe between the JVM and Wrapper was not being
  cleaned up correctly.  This resulted in a small leak but was otherwise
  harmless.  The pipes are now cleaned up and initialized for each JVM
  instance.
* Fix a problem where the Wrapper could fail to restart the JVM when the
  restart request originated in the JVM if the system was experiencing very
  heavy IO resulting in long disk IO queues.   This was causing the Wrapper's
  main loop to block on the write and miss the restart request, causing the
  Wrapper to shutdown rather than restart.  This could affect all platforms.
  On Windows, it could also be reproduced by making a selection in the console
  to freeze output and then making a request from within the JVM to restart.
* Add a new WrapperPropertyUtil helper class to make it easer to access Wrapper
  property values from within the JVM.
* Fix a bug on some platforms where java log output could get corrupted due to
  misuse of a strncpy system function.  This function warns that some
  implementations do not support overlapping memory copies.  The problem could
  only be reproduced on a single Linux test machine in lines following an empty
  line of output.  This problem has existed since 3.4.0.

3.5.10
* Setting wrapper.jvm.port to '0' (zero) will make the JVM to assign an 
  available port for the backend socket by itself.
* Add warnings in the log file if an integer configuration property value
  contains a non-numerical value.  Previously, the Wrapper would silently
  ignore the problem and use the value of 0 if the number started with an
  invalid character, it will now return the default value.  If the property
  value started with valid numerical characters then those were, and still will
  be, used to generate a value, but the invalid characters will be trimmed.
  The later is being kept this way to avoid breaking old configurations.
* Add warnings in the log file if a boolean configuration property has any
  value other than TRUE or FALSE.  It will still return a value of FALSE
  for other values to avoid breaking old configurations.
* Add a warning if an invalid value is specified for the wrapper.on_exit.<n>
  property.
* Add a new wrapper.log.lf_delay.threshold property which makes it possible
  to control how long a partial line of Java log output will be allowed to be
  buffered until it is completed with a line feed.  If the threshold is
  exceeded then the partial line will be logged as a full line resulting in an
  extra line feed in the log output.  All previous versions would do this
  within 1-2 ms.  The default is now 500ms.
* (Standard, Professional) Make it possible to customize the manufacturer
  through the customize options.
* (Professional) Fix a problem where the Wrapper was sending a CTRL-BREAK
  rather than a CTRL-C signal to child processes launched with
  WrapperManager.exec when destroying them on Windows.  For most child
  processes this was not a problem, but if the direct child process was a JVM
  then the CTRL-BREAK was triggering a thread dump rather than asking the JVM
  to exit.  The Wrapper was then timing out and forcibly killing the JVM child
  process.
* (Standard, Professional) Fixed a bug, where the timezone ICT when set by
  the wrapper.timezone property got misinterpreted as IST.
* (Standard, Professional) Fixed a problem where the UTC offset value in the 
  wrapper.timezone property was not being parsed correctly on UNIX platforms.
  This led to the Wrapper to using an offset UTC0000.
* Take out the warning about unset LANG environment variable on Linux and 
  AIX systems.  On system startup, some systems fail to set the LANG
  environment variable.  This is not really a problem for the Wrapper and the
  warning was causing confusion for users so we decided to remove it.

3.5.9
* (Standard, Professional) Fix a problem on Windows where network adapters
  whose names contained "PRO/1000" were being removed from the list of hostids
  displayed when "wrapper.exe -h" was run.  This did not affect existing server
  license key files generated for hostIds reported by 3.5.7 or earlier, or
  development license keys.  But it did cause the Wrapper to report that no
  valid hostIds could be found when the Wrapper was started without a license
  file.  This was caused by some test code added in 3.5.8 that we failed to
  remove.
* Fix a problem where the Wrapper was not correctly yielding control back to
  its main loop when very large amounts of continuous output was being logged
  from the JVM.  Introduced in version 3.4.0.  In versions prior to 3.5.8, this
  could have caused the JVM to timeout and restart itself.  That particular
  issue was resolved but the Wrapper process in 3.5.8 would still have been
  unresponsive when this was happening.  The Wrapper will now always yeild back
  to its main loop after 250 milliseconds of continuous logging.
* Fix a problem where the WrapperManager could block trying write debug output
  if the current user application was writing very large amounts of output to
  the console as well.  In extreme circumstances this led to the Wrapper
  thinking that the JVM was frozen.  This was only an issue if debug output was
  enabled.
* Restructured the shell script so all editions now use the same script again.

3.5.8
* (Standard, Professional) Starting with version 3.5.5, we invalidated the use
  of all 00ff* hostids on Windows to avoid problems with changing hostids when
  users have a Juniper Network Connect network adapter on their system.  This
  turned out to be too restrictive as Guest OSs running under Parallels also
  make use of this hostid range.  The Wrapper is now more careful to only
  invalidate actual Juniper Network Connect hostids.
* (Standard, Professional) Improve the message shown to the user when the
  Wrapper is unable to locate any hostids for a system.
* Fixed a problem with the wrapper script on Solaris, where the option -F was
  not available for grep.
* Added Windows version information on the wrapper debug output.
* Added a wrapper.log.warning.threshold property which makes the Wrapper show
  a warning whenever it detects that the Wrapper took a long time to record a
  log message.  This was added to test a reported issue caused by slow IO on
  very heavily loaded systems.
* Added a new 'G' log format to log the time in milliseconds of the previous
  log message.  See documentation with the wrapper.log.warning.threshold
  property.  Added to the wrapper.console.format, wrapper.logfile.format, and
  wrapper.logdialog.format properties.
* Fix a problem where a filter that requested the JVM to restart would be
  ignored if the JVM exited on its own immediately.  The Wrapper is now more
  consistent so that restart requests from within the JVM or filters will
  always take priority over such exit requests.  External shutdown requests, or
  those from other actions will still behave as they did in the past and
  continue to shutdown the Wrapper.  The Wrapper also logs messages in debug
  output if an outstanding restart request is being preserved or ignored.
* Fixed a problem in the AppCommand.bat batch file which could occur on some
  Windows platforms with certain multi-byte system encodings. The script has
  been rewritten and questionable parts have been simplified. The functionality
  of the script has been preserved.
* Added the environment variable WRAPPER_CONF_DIR, which can be used for 
  the configuration properties.  Feature Request #3160644.
* Made the script exit with the right exit code received when running the
  script as different user, specified in RUN_AS_USER.  Bug #3185281.
* Fix an access violation which could happen when reporting that the code
  signing certificate has failed to been verified.
* Log an error if the backend socket is forcibly closed externally.  It had
  been getting logged at a debug log level.  The message is "An existing
  connection was forcibly closed by the remote host. (0x2746)".  Because the
  message was only logged if debug output was enabled, the JVM would be
  restarted with no clear explanation as to what happened.  The source of the
  socket closure is under investigation.
* (Professional) Added the Java call fireUserEvent to the WrapperManager API.
  This enables to fire user event mails, actions without the filter trigger.
* Fix a warning on Mac versions if the configured java command was not a
  universal binary.  A check was added in 3.4.0 to make sure that the
  wrapper.java.command pointed directly to an executable to avoid unexpected
  behavior when running a script.  The message is only a warning and the
  Wrapper continues regardless.  Standard ppc, ppc_64, x86_64, i386, as well
  as the universal binaries will now all work correctly without a warning.
* The default value of the wrapper.*.umask properties is using the current
  umask the process has. Before the default value was always 0022.
* Add a new wrapper.backend.type property that is used to control whether the
  Wrapper communicates with the JVM using the traditional "SOCKET" or new
  experimental "PIPE".  This was added as a workaround to a rare problem where
  some Windows machines are closing the socket at an OS level.  This was only
  ever seen on Windows 2003, but could exist on other Windows versions as well.
* Add a new experimental wrapper.use_javaio_thread property which causes the
  Wrapper to handle all java console output in a dedicated thread.
* Add a new WrapperManager.isNativeLibraryOk() method which lets user code
  easily test whether or not the native library was loaded and initialized on
  startup.
* Add a new PAUSE_THREAD command to the wrapper.commandfile property which
  makes it possible to test how the Wrapper behaves when various threads block
  or freeze.  This was used to simulate and reproduce issues on heavily IO
  bound servers.
* Improve the way the Java side of the Wrapper behaves when the Wrapper fails
  to ping the JVM for an extended period of time.  The JVM used to exit to let
  itself resync itself with the JVM.  This was causing problems on systems
  which were heavily IO bound because the Wrapper could block for a while while
  trying to write to the log file and the JVM was exiting.  The JVM will now
  never exit under such circumstances.  The JVM will never become orphaned
  because it will still exit almost immediately if the backend socket or pipe
  with the Wrapper is ever closed.
* Deprecate the WrapperManager.appearOrphan() method as it is used to simulate
  a failure mode which is no longer possible with the Wrapper.
* Changed the way the Wrapper is handling certificate errors regarding the 
  code signing/timestamping certificate. The Wrapper will now only shutdown 
  itself if the signature of the binary was not successfully verified because 
  the binary or signature has been malformed but not if any problem with 
  the counter-signer has been found.  Starting with 3.5.7, the Windows Wrapper
  binaries are signed.  Some users with locked down Windows 2008 systems had
  problems with the Wrapper refusing to start because the Comodo certificate
  had been disabled on their system.
* Add a new wrapper.java.detach_started property which makes it possible to use
  the Wrapper as a simple tool to launch Java applications.  When enabled, the
  Wrapper terminates immediately and the JVM is left to run on its own.  Also
  add new wrapper.java.outfile and wrapper.java.errfile properties which make
  it possible to redirect the stdout and stderr of the JVM to files when
  detached.
* When running the Wrapper as a specified User Account, through the 
  wrapper.ntservice.account property, the Wrapper will add permission for the
  account to log on as service automatically upon install.  Feature Request
  #3286491.
* Fixed a problem binding the backend socket on Windows. If another process 
  bound a port inside the wrapper.port.min and wrapper.port.max range using the
  SO_EXCLUSIVEADDRUSE option, the Wrapper would stop at this port report 
  an Access Permission problem and omits binding any further port in the range.
  This problem existed ever since the Wrapper was released.

3.5.7
* Changed the way the script is installing the daemon gets installed on an AIX
  system. The script now uses inittab & SRC.
* Fix a problem in the shell script that was preventing the script from
  starting the Wrapper correctly if a file or directory existed in the current
  working directory which was one character in length.  This was only a problem
  when the delta-pack naming of the Wrapper was used.  This was easy to
  reproduce on AIX systems on system restart because a "u" directory exists in
  the root directory by default.  This had been a problem since 3.4.0 when
  it was introduced as a fix to a Solaris problem.  The root cause was a
  missing set of quotes in the tr command.
* Fix a problem in the shell script that was preventing the script from finding
  the running wrapper process when it was started when the working directory
  was in the same directory as the wrapper binary, but queried later from
  another location.  It would also fail if it was started from another
  location, but then queried from the location of the Wrapper.  This was
  introduced in version 3.5.6 when the script stopped changing the working
  directory in the script.
* Add a new GC action that will cause the JVM to immediately perform a full
  garbage collection sweep.  See the wrapper.commandfile,
  wrapper.filter.action.<n>, wrapper.check.deadlock.action, and
  wrapper.timer.<n>.action properties for details.
* (Professional) Modify the wrapper.event.<event_name>.command.block.action
  property slightly so it will now correctly warn if an unknown action is
  encountered.  It had been defaulting to CONTINUE silently.
* Modify the timing of the message shown when an #encoding directive is missing
  from the top of a configuration file.  It was only being logged if debug
  output was enabled.  It will now also be logged if the #include.debug
  directive is specified.
* Fix the indentation of warning messages about encoding or include problems in
  configuration files.
* (Standard, Professional) Fix a problem where include file problems could
  cause the shell script to have errors due to invalid translated output from
  the Wrapper.
* Add a warning when the maximum include depth is reached and include debugging
  is enabled.  The Wrapper had always just silently skipped the include.
* Fix a problem where #include.required directive was not correctly preventing
  startup if the include file was missing but the required include was in a
  nested include.
* Fix a problem where the cause of some fatal include problems were not being
  logged correctly, resulting in a simple, non-informative message only that
  the configuration file failed to be loaded.  This was a problem since 3.5.5.
* Fix a Windows problem where the Wrapper could fail to start as a service if a
  defined environment variable would expand to a length larger than the 32k
  limit specified in the ExpandEnvironmentStrings system function.  This was a
  problem on all Windows platforms prior to version 3.5.5, but only on Windows
  2000 since then, when the code used to reload the environment from the
  registry was disabled for newer versions of Windows.  We now simply skip the
  expansion of the problem variable and continue with a warning.  Bug #3103776.
* Add a set of optional system properties that the WrapperSimpleApp,
  WrapperStartStopApp, and WrapperJarApp helper classes are aware of to tell
  them to ignore uncaught exceptions thrown within the main methods of the user
  application.  The exceptions will still be logged, but they can now be
  configured so that the main method is just allowed to end without causing the
  Wrapper to shutdown in an error state.  Java on its own will stay running in
  such a case as long as it has launched at least one non-daemon thread prior
  to the uncaught exception being thrown.  This does not affect most users, but
  an application was found that was having problems because of this difference
  in behavior.  See the javadocs of the helper classes for details.
* (Professional) Fix a problem when looking for the correct exit code to use
  for the wrapper.event.<event_name>.command.on_exit.<n> property.  The Wrapper
  now searches for a value as follows:
  wrapper.event.<event_name>.command.on_exit.<n>,
  wrapper.event.<event_name>.command.on_exit.default,
  wrapper.event.default.command.on_exit.<n>, then
  wrapper.event.default.command.on_exit.default.  The third pattern had been
  getting skipped in previous versions since it was added in version 3.3.0.
* (Professional) Add logic to report a warning if an unexpected value is
  specified for the wrapper.event.<event_name>.command.on_exit.<n> or
  wrapper.event.<event_name>.command.block.action properties.
* (Professional) Clean up the message log levels so the output is as expected
  when using the wrapper.event.<event_name>.command.loglevel property.
* (Professional) Improve the wrapper.event.<event_name>.command.on_exit.<n>
  property so the configured action will now work even if the command exits
  after the block time out has expired.  In previous versions, there was no
  way to make the Wrapper do anything other than continue.
* (Professional) Fix a problem where the Wrapper was failing to detect a JVM
  exit correctly if an event command had been fired first.  The only problem
  was that the Wrapper was always reporting a JVM exit code of 0 rather than
  the actual exit code.
* Fix a buffer overflow on Windows when either installing as a service, or
  updating an existing service.  The problem only occurred when properties
  containing spaces, or Java passthrough arguments containing spaces were
  specified on the command line.  The running service did not have any
  problems.  This was introduced in 3.5.0.
* (Standard, Professional) Improve the error message logged when an unlicensed
  version of the Wrapper's native library is used.
* (Standard, Professional) Fix a buffer overflow problem on Windows when
  creating a customized Wrapper binary if the target binary name did not
  include the ".exe" extension.  This problem existed since its intruduction in
  version 3.3.7.
* The wrapper.exe, wrapperw.exe and wrapper.dll binaries are now being signed
  on Windows making it possible to verify that valid Tanuki Software binaries
  are being used.
* Implemented a way to install, remove, start, stop, etc., the Wrapper as a
  Windows service from a non-elevated (UAC) console.  The Wrapper is elevated
  transparently using a child process.  This is needed starting with Windows
  Vista and 2008 for smooth interaction with the Windows Service Manager.
* (Standard, Professional) Fix a problem where the wrapperjni_*.mo localized
  files were not being loaded correctly.  These messages are only shown when
  debug output is enabled.  Application and Wrapper localization was working
  fine.  Introduced in 3.5.5.
* (Standard, Professional) Enhanced the ability to run with localizations
  other than the system language on Windows.  The Wrapper process locale was
  not being set correctly.  So Japanese text was not always showing correctly
  if the wrapper.lang property was set when the OS was English or German.
  The Java process still has an issue where it will always start with the
  system default value for the file.encoding system property.  This can still
  cause problems writing Japanese text when the file.encoding is German for
  example.
* Added support in the shell script for starting/installing the wrapper on
  system boot with Upstart.
* Fix a problem in the shell script where it would fail to recognize a running
  Wrapper if the Wrapper command line or path contained a square bracket.
* Modify the way we test for the existance of the temp directory so we now
  generate our own file name rather than using File.createTempFile.  On some
  systems createTempFile was taking a long time because it requires that Java
  initialize its internal entropy.  We discovered that large numbers of files
  in the java.tmpdir directory makes Java's entropy initialization code very
  slow.  This has been a potential issue since 3.5.0.
* Fixed a problem on Windows where passthrough arguments after a "--" which
  contained spaces were not being passed through to the JVM intact, they were
  being split at the spaces into multiple arguments.
* Fix a problem on Windows where the Wrapper could sometimes crash on shutdown
  if more than one thread got into the cleanup code at the same time.  This
  did not affect running applications and was only an issue on shutdown.  It
  was more likely if a language pack was loaded.  Introduced in 3.5.3.  

3.5.6
* Fix a problem on UNIX platforms where the log file path was being calculated
  incorrectly if an absolute path was specified for wrapper.logfile, and the
  file did not already exist.   A warning message was being displayed but the
  Wrapper would continue using the default log file.  There was a problem in
  the message displayed which caused a crash on some platforms include Mac OSX.
  Introduced in version 3.5.5.
* Fix a problem on Windows platforms where the Wrapper would crash if it could
  not access the directory of the configured wrapper.logfile. 
  Introduced in version 3.5.5.  Bug #3087424.
* Improve the way warnings are logged when there are problems writing to the
  configured wrapper.logfile so that the message will now be logged into the
  log file that the Wrapper ends up using in case it is successful in falling
  back to a default log file.
* Fix a problem on Windows platforms where wrapper.java.additional.<n>
  properties that were specified on the command line, and contained spaces,
  were not being requoted correctly when building up the Java command line.
  Introduced in version 3.3.6.
* Fix a problem where the warning message logged for invalid values of the
  wrapper.java.additional.<n> property, contained corrupted text.  Introduced
  in version 3.3.6.
* Fix a problem on UNIX platforms where an invalid value for the
  wrapper.java.additional.<n> property was correctly being reported and then
  skipped, but the resulting command line to launch the JVM had a blank value
  that was causing the JVM to fail to launch.  An invalid value is any value
  that does not begin with a "-" character.
* Add a new WRAPPER_INIT_DIR environment variable which can be used to
  reference the working directory from which the Wrapper was launched.  This is
  needed for certain applications because the Wrapper always changes its
  working directory to the location of the Wrapper binary.
* Modify the UNIX shell script so it no longer changes the current working dir
  to the location of the script.  This is no longer needed because the Wrapper
  has been changing the working directory to its own location since version
  3.2.0.
* Add a new wrapper.request_thread_dump_on_failed_jvm_exit.delay property to
  control how long the Wrapper will wait after doing a thread dump before
  killing the Java process.  This delay has always been hardcoded to 5 seconds.
* Clean up the text of several warning messages about invalid configuration
  values to make them more consistent.
* (Professional) Add a new wrapper.jvm_kill.delay property which makes it
  possible to control the amount of time to allow between the jvm_kill event
  being fired and the JVM actually being killed.  Useful if an external event
  command is fired that needs to do something with the JVM process first.
* (Professional) Fix a problem where the output of the
  wrapper.event.<event_name>.message and wrapper.event.<event_name>.loglevel
  properties were not displaying correctly on UNIX platforms.
* (Professional) Fix a problem on UNIX platforms where the Java side of the
  Wrapper was not being correctly notified if a large number of child
  processes that had been launched with WrapperManager.exec, exited at the
  same instant.  Some of them were going into a defunct state until the next
  child exited, at which point they would be cleaned up.  This was mainly an
  issue on JVM shutdown if the user code was calling WrapperProcess.waitFor()
  as part of its shutdown process.   WaitFor calls at any point were getting
  stuck and would remain so until another child exited.  As part of this fix,
  there were also several changes to the Windows implementation to bring the
  two code bases into sync.
* Fix a problem on Windows when multiple threads were creating Childobjects,
  Handles could have been unintendedly get inherited by another Child Process,
  causing problems on reading/writing to the Input/Output/Errorstream.
* Fix a problem on solaris and AIX when errno calls were not thread safe due
  to a compiler switch.
* Fix a problem where debug level warning output while loading the Wrapper
  configuration was being displayed on startup.   This could be fixed because
  the Wrapper actually loads the configuration twice, and such output is now
  only logged on the second call.
* (Standard, Professional) Remove the undocumented ability to define a single
  file share mapping without the index.  This would cause confusion if used,
  and complicated the code.
* (Standard, Professional) Fix a byte alignment problem caused by a bad
  compiler directive on Windows platforms.  It was known to cause a crash when
  defining mapped drives on 64-bit Windows versions.  The problem was in the
  source since version 3.3.7, but is not known to cause any other issues.
* (Standard, Professional) Modify the messages displayed when network shares
  are mapped or fail for some reason.  Also add messages about them being
  unmapped on shutdown.
* On some Windows platforms, a failure to delete a rolled log file was not
  being reported correctly.  The system function to delete a file was
  returning success even if it had failed.  We now double check.
* Fix a deadlock in the code that is used to send data to the Java process.
  It was only possible if debug level output was enabled and log file rolling
  was enabled.  Introduced in 3.3.7.
* Fix a problem where the Wrapper was not notifying the JVM whenever the log
  file was rolled and the new name was the same as the previous one, as it is
  when wrapper.logfile.rollmode is anything other than NONE or DATE.
* Fix a problem where the WrapperManager.getWrapperLogFile() was not returning
  the accurate log file name until the first time the log file was rolled after
  each JVM invocation.  This was only noticeable if the wrapper.logfile
  contained either the "ROLLNUM" or "YYYYMMDD" tokens.
* Correct an error message that was displayed on UNIX platforms when the
  configured java binary could not be accessed.  The message referenced a
  buffer whose contents were undefined on some platforms.
* Fix a problem on z/OS where due a difference in the API used to lock a
  mutex compared to all other UNIX platforms, the mutex's locking and
  unlocking code were effectively being ignored.  This means that multiple
  threads were able to access code which was not thread safe and could lead to
  a crash of the Wrapper.   This is a problem that has been in the code since
  the first z/OS release and is not known to have actually caused any problems.
  Starting with 3.5.1, this was only an issue if debug output was enabled.
  Versions 3.3.9 through 3.5.0 could have also had problems whenever the
  Wrapper received a system signal.

3.5.5
* Add new wrapper.filter.trigger.<n> action, "SUCCESS".  If this gets triggered
  then the Wrapper will treat the current JVM invocation as a success, and
  reset its internal failed invocation counter.  This is useful for
  applications that need to be restarted frequently.
* (Standard, Professional) Ignore Juniper Network Connect hostIds as they
  change on each reboot and are thus unreliable as hostIds.
* Added a PASS_THROUGH setting to the UNIX shell script and Windows
  AppCommand.bat.in files which tells them to pass any extra arguments directly
  on to the JVM when it is launched.
* Added a FIXED_COMMAND setting to the UNIX shell script and Windows
  AppCommand.bat.in files to make it possible to run either without specifying
  a command.  Mainly useful in conjunction with PASS_THROUGH.
* (Standard, Professional) Added a --passthrough option to the exe
  customization, in order to tell the wrapper to precede the whole command line
  through to the application in the JVM.
* (Standard, Professional) Added a --conf option to change the default conf
  file, the wrapper tries opening when no conf file was explicitly specified.
* Added wrapper.ntservice.account.prompt.  If set to TRUE the wrapper will
  prompt for all account details (domain, account name, password).
* Fix a minor issue in #include file declarations where a leading space was not
  required.
* Add a new #include.required directive which works the same as the #include
  directive except that it will output an error and prevent the loading of the
  configuration if the included file does not exist.   Normally include files
  are optional by design.
* Modify the error messages displayed when configuration files fail to load so
  they now provide more information about where specifically the problem was.
* Disabled the forced reloading of the SYSTEM (and if set to a specific
  account, the user) registry before launching the Wrapper as a service on
  Windows.  This was done originally in Windows NT because changes to the
  configured environment were not being reflected when running a service unless
  the system was first rebooted.  Microsoft appears to have solved this problem
  in Windows XP and 2003.  In Windows 7 and 2008, this was actually causing a
  problem because the SYSTEM registry contains a setting "USERNAME=SYSTEM" by
  default that was overwriting the USERNAME when run as specific user.  It was
  decided to disable this registry loading for Windows versions starting with
  XP and 2003.  Of the supported versions, only 2000 is now reloading its
  environment.  The only difference from version 3.5.4 and earlier that could
  be found is that when running as the SYSTEM user on Windows 7 or 2008, the
  USERNAME environment variable will now be set to the host name followed by a
  dollar sign rather than SYSTEM.   This is actually how all other services
  work.  But just in case this is a problem, it can we resolved by adding a
  "set.USERNAME=SYSTEM" property into the Wrapper configuration file.
  Bug #3061490.
* (Standard, Professional) Fix a problem for Solaris and HP-UX where the socket
  timeout properties for the email notifications were ignored.
* (Standard, Professional) Added wrapper.ntservice.recovery.<x> properties to 
  define system level actions in the event that the Wrapper process itself
  has a failure.
* (Standard, Professional) Fixed a problem in the WrapperProcess.waitFor() and
  WrapperProcess.exitValue() call, where it would fail to return when called
  after the Wrapper had initiated the shutdown of the JVM.
* (Standard, Professional) Add WrapperProcessConfig.setSoftShutdownTimeout(int)
  method to tell the Wrapper how long to wait after nicely asking the child
  process to shutdown cleanly when calling WrapperProcess.destroy().  Once the
  timeout has ellapsed, the child process will be forcibly terminated.  This
  timeout had been hard coded to 5 seconds in earlier versions.
* Add more detailed usage output to the UNIX shell script.
* Make it possible to 'pause' and 'resume' the JVM from the UNIX shell and
  Windows batch scripts.
* (Professional) Fix a minor memory memory leak while initializing timers.
* Fix a memory leak which could happen if there were any invalid strings in
  localization resources.
* (Professional) Fix a bug where the wrapper.event.<event_type>.command.argv.<n>
  properties were not correctly parsed on Windows. This issue was introduced
  in version 3.5.0.
* (Professional) Add the ability to define wrapper.event.default.command.argv.<n>
  properties that will be used if the event specific specific commands are not
  defined.  Mainly useful for testing.
* Fix a problem occuring when the wrapper failed to roll the log file causing 
  to write to the wrapper's default log (wrapper.log) file rather than
  continuing to write to the current logfile.
* (Standard, Professional) Fix a put problem in the internal hash map
  implemenation used for localization where values could be lost.  This was
  not a visible issue because of the data used.
* Add new wrapper.filter.allow_wildcards.<n> property and make it possible to
  specify wrapper.filter.trigger.<n> patterns which contain '*' and '?'
  wildcards.
* Add a commented alternative in the default OutOfMemoryError filter
  configuration to make it more specific to only trigger on uncaught exception
  stack traces.  This is to avoid output like that from the
  -XX:+PrintClassHistogram JVM argument from causing the JVM to restart with a
  false out of memory warning.  See the wrapper.filter.trigger.<n>
  OutOfMemoryError example for more details.
* Localize the default filter message.
* Added ISO-8859-* encoding support and a few other encodings.
* (Standard, Professional) Fix a problem on UNIX versions, parsing dates in
  license keys that was introduced in version 3.5.0.  Windows verisons did not
  have this problem.  All license upgrade terms and lease terms which contained
  "08" or "09" as either a month or day were being parsed incorrectly.  This
  was leading the Wrapper to interpret those date components as "00".  If the
  number was the date, then this would cause the date to be set to the last day
  of the previous month.  If it was the month however, it would cause the date
  to be set to December of the previous year.  For example "2010-08-20" was
  being interpreted as "2009-12-20", and "2010-10-08" was being interpreted as
  "2009-09-30".  This would have prevented some licenses from being able to
  start because the upgrade terms were in effect prior to the Wrapper's release
  date.  Some trial licenses could also have stopped early because their lease
  term end was earlier that it should may have been.  For normal licenses, his
  will have no effect on installations once they are up and running because
  they do not use the lease term.
* Fix a problem on Windows when a service received several service control
  codes in rapid succession.  Since version 3.5.1, the Wrapper was only to
  process a single control code in each cycle of its main loop.  This was
  resulting in messages like "Previous control code (4) was still in queue,
  overwriting with (4)." in the logs.  The Wrapper can now handle up to 25
  control codes per 10ms cycle.
* Fix a problem where it was not possible to send passthrough arguments to the
  JVM when installing or updating a Windows Service.  Passthrough using the
  "--" argument was added in 3.5.2.
* Add a new wrapper.pause_on_startup property which makes it possible to tell
  the Wrapper to go directly into a paused state without ever launching a JVM.
* Fix a problem where the STOP command set in a command file was being ignored
  if the Wrapper was currently in a paused state.
* Make it possible to specify DEFAULT for the configuration file encoding.
  This will cause the file to be loaded using the default system encoding.  We
  added this by request, but recommend using a portable encoding like UTF-8 to
  ensure that the configuration file will load correctly on all systems.
* Added a WRAPPER_LANG environment variable which makes it possible to reference
  the current locale language code in the configuration file.   One common use
  is to do localization using inclues.
  (e.g. #include ../conf/wrapper-%WRAPPER_LANG%.conf)

3.5.4
* Add optional support for custom public static methods in the
  WrapperSimpleApp and WrapperStartStopApp helper classes.  Feature Request
  #2812276.
* Add a new special configuration file directive "#properties.debug" which
  enables debug output about the properties as they are loaded by the
  configuration file.  This can be useful to tell if and why certain properties
  are being overwritten.  Feature Request #3042959.
* Fix a minor problem where the "#include.debug" configuration file directive
  was sticky so it would be enabled when the configuration file was reloaded
  even if the reloaded configuration file no longer had the directive set.
  This was only an issue if the wrapper.restart.reload_configuration property
  was set.
* Messages about missing included configuration files that were output when the
  #include.debug" configuration file directive was active were being logged at
  the ERROR level even though they were not problems.
* Fix a minor problem where the WRAPPER_JAVA_HOME environment variable was not
  correctly being set to final when it was set internally by Wrapper.  This
  could lead to unexected results if the user overwrote it later in their
  configuration file.
* Fix a problem on AIX and z/OS, when running the Wrapper without any
  arguments.  The Wrapper was attempting to use the default wrapper.conf file
  but the check for the file was failing causing the Wrapper to continue even
  though the file did not exist.  This caused a confusing error message to be
  displayed, but was otherwise harmless.
* Clean up some debug code associated with sleeping where log output was being
  queued when it did not need to be.
* (Standard, Professional) Consolidate some redundant code associated with
  waiting for interfaces on startup.
* (Professional) Fix a problem in the email feature of the Wrapper where a
  subject of more than 27 bytes in length when encoded as UTF-8.  This was
  caused by a miscalculation in the Base64 conversion of the subject.
* (Professional) Fix a problem when the WrapperManager.exec method which takes
  an array of command elements was called on Windows.  The command elements
  need to be combined into a single command line, but if any of the elements
  contained spaces, the resulting command line was not being correctly quoted.
* Add a new wrapper.java.command.resolve property to control whether or not the
  Wrapper tries to resolve any symbolic links in the Java command, specified
  with the wrapper.java.command property.  Historically, it has always done so,
  but some jvm started applications like run-java-tool on Gentoo will fail if
  it is run directly as they have a check to make sure it is launched via a
  symbolic link.
* Fix a problem on Windows versions where a path to the Wrapper binary,
  including the Wrapper binary itself, which was more than 100 characters would
  cause a buffer overflow when installing the service.  A second similar
  problem would happen if the same path was more than 128 characters, whenever
  the Wrapper was launched.   These were both very old issues and only happened
  on 32-bit versions of Windows XP and 2000.  Microsoft documentation says that
  the issue should also exist on the 64-bit versions, but we were unable to
  reproduce it there.  Newer versions of Windows are all fine.

3.5.3
* Fix a typo in the UNIX shell scripts that was causing "command not found"
  errors to be shown when running the Community Edition.
* Add new wrapper.console.fatal_to_stderr, wrapper.console.error_to_stderr,
  and wrapper.console.warn_to_stderr properties to control whether the output
  at the FATAL, ERROR, and WARN log levels go to stdout or stderr.  In the past
  they all went to stdout.  With this change, FATAL and ERROR log levels now
  default to stderr output.
* Fix a problem where the shell script would produce unexpected results if the
  Standard or Professional Edition shell scripts were used with the Community
  Edition Wrapper.  Fix was in Wrapper binary by changing the default ERROR and
  FATAL log level console output to stderr rather than stdout.
* (Standard, Professional) Fix a problem where script error message output was
  not being shown if the wrapper.conf file specified in the script did not
  exist.
* Fix a problem where errors from failed forks on Windows were always being
  flushed immediately rather than honoring the value of the
  wrapper.console.flush property.
* Fix a problem on Windows 2000 systems where a new feature added in 3.5.2 was
  preventing the Wrapper from running because the API used was too new.
* Change the font of the wrapperw dialog in order to have prettier output of
  multibyte characters.
* Add a line feed after the first message when starting the Wrapper from the
  UNIX script.
* Add a note in the debug output so the configured java temporary directory is
  always logged to help with debugging.
* Add a workaround for a bug in both Sun and IBM JVMs which cause an invalid
  exception to be thrown when a socket is already bound.  It had been causing
  the Wrapper to report: "Unexpected exception opening backend socket:
  java.net.SocketException: Unrecognized Windows Sockets error: 0: JVM_Bind":
  http://bugs.sun.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=6965962
* Add the encoding of the subjects in the event mails to be always UTF-8
  Base-64 encoded.
* Add new wrapper.event.<x>.email.smtp.auth.type,
  wrapper.event.<x>.email.smtp.auth.userid, and
  wrapper.event.<x>.email.smtp.auth.password properties which make it possible
  to do LOGIN and PLAIN connection authorizations.  Currently SSL (STARTTLS)
  connections to the mail are server are not yet supported.
* Fix a buffer overflow while loading the configuration file on Mac OSX
  versions.  Introduced in 3.5.0.
* Fix a several memory leaks on UNIX versions that were added in 3.5.0, as well
  as a few others on all platforms, some from quite early versions.
* Fix some places where a resolved path of exactly MAX_PATH characters in
  length could have resulted in a buffer overflow.
* (Standard, Professional) Fix a memory leak disposing language packs.
* Go through and increase the consistency of text strings.
* Fix a problem on HP-UX where the Wrapper was logging a warning that the
  configured JVM was invalid if it was a PA-RISC 2.0 binary.  Bug #3037317.
* Fix a problem where the WrapperManager was failing to trap and hide errors
  initializing the MBean server on some JVMs that did not support it.

3.5.2
* Added new command line argument "--" . All arguments following will be
  preceded and passed to the java application. The arguments are attached after
  the arguments used in wrapper.app.parameter.<n>
* Fixed a problem in the shell script which could lead to report failed starts
  of a daemon incorrectly on the command line.
* Implemented some small logic in the wrapper script which tries to change the
  permissions of the wrapper binary to executable if it wasn't set.
* The Demo Application had problems locating the right conf file on Unix
  platforms and failed to launch the internal demonstration wrapper process.
* Improved the error message logged if the Windows version of the Wrapper exits
  with an internal error.  It now logs more information about the internal
  state of the Wrapper as well as saving a mini dump file which can be sent to
  support to make it easier to diagnose the cause of the problem.
* Fix a problem where the names and displayNames in WrapperWin32Service
  instances were corrupted.  List affected the WrapperManager.listServices()
  and WrapperManager.sendServiceControlCode() methods.  There was a similar
  problem with the WrapperManger.getUser(), WrapperManager.getInteractiveUser()
  and WrapperManager.setConsoleTitle() methods.  Introduced in 3.5.0.
* Fix a problem on Windows where wildcards would sometimes fail to be resolved
  or cause the Wrapper to crash.  This affected the generation of classpaths
  and logfile rolling.  Introduced in 3.5.0.
* Fix a problem on UNIX platforms where some error messages related to a failed
  fork to launch the JVM were not being logged correctly.  Introduced in 3.5.0.
* Fix a problem where invalid characters in configuration files that did not
  declare an encoding could cause the Wrapper to crash on startup.  This could
  be issue for users upgrading from versions prior to 3.5.0 as older versions
  did not do any character set translations and would not have had a problem.
* Fix a problem in code to check whether a drive was a mapped network drive or
  not was failing.  This would sometimes lead to a false warning that the drive
  could not be identified.  Introduced in 3.5.0.
* Add a new ACCESS_VIOLATION command to the wrapper.commandfile property to
  test how the Wrapper and external systems behave if the Wrapper were to
  crash.  Only enabled when the wrapper.commandfile.enable_tests property is
  enabled.

3.5.1
* Start using a system function to determine whether or not a character in the
  configuration file is a control character or not.  This way it works on
  non-ASCII platforms.
* (Standard, Professional) Fix a crash on Windows platforms caused by freeing
  up unallocated memory while loading the Wrapper's configuration.
* Add debug output describing the system and current code pages on Windows
  versions to help understand encoding and mojibake issues.
* Add a Japanese localized src/conf/wrapper.conf.in_ja template configuration
  file to assist Japanese users.
* Fix an potential deadlock on UNIX platforms if the JVM exits while logging
  is taking place and the wrapper.debug or undocumented wrapper.state_output
  properties were set to TRUE.
* Fix a problem where a failed JVM invocation that happened immediately after
  being launched would cause the Wrapper to immediately give up and shutdown.
  This should not have been possible with normal JVM configurations, but was
  turned up in testing.
* Fix a problem where some startup output of the tick timer debug output was
  corrupted.  This was only an issue if the wrapper.tick_output property was
  set.
* (Standard, Professional) Rework the way text is localized so that mallocs
  are all handled on initialization.  3.5.0 had problems with occassional
  freezes and crashes caused by mallocs being made within signal handlers.
  The problems were rare unless debug output was enabled.
* Greatly simplify signal handlers on all platforms so they now do as little
  as possible, actions are now queued and then processed by the main thread.
* (Standard, Professional) Fix a problem where the hostname in the 
  wrapper.syslog.remote.host couldn't resolve a hostname (IP Address was
  working).
* (Standard, Professional) Add debug output on Windows versions to help debug
  localization and code page issues.
* (Standard, Professional) Fix a localization problem on Windows where the
  Wrapper was using the system-wide language rather than that of the current
  process.  This was resulting in mojibake if the Wrapper was launched in a
  new console if that new console did not support the required code page.
  This was only an issue if the user had changed the active code page from the
  default for their Windows desktop.
* Fix a problem on Windows platforms where the JVM child output was being
  logged with an extra line feed in some cases.
* Fix a problem running the DemoApp from some Network shares on Windows.
* Add a new WrapperManager.isWindows() and WrapperManager.isMacOSX() methods to
  make it easy to write such conditional code as both platforms can require non
  standard code.
* (Standard, Professional) Make the GetHostId.bat file more robust so it can be
  executed using a relative reference from the command line.  It also now
  supports Delta-pack style Wrapper binary naming and falling back to use which
  binaries are available.
* Change the timing of when the wrapper.working.dir is set so that any error
  messages generated while loading the configuration will be logged to the
  correct log file.  It is also needed for Standard and Professional Editions
  to ensure that the language pack is loaded from the correct location so that
  all such messages will be in the correct locale.
* Fix a problem on UNIX platforms where the status command was failing with an
  error due to the localization feature added in 3.5.0.

3.5.0
* (Standard) Added the ability to detect and react to thread dead locks in
  the JVM.  Requires at Java 1.5.  Added wrapper.check.deadlock,
  wrapper.check.deadlock.interval, wrapper.check.deadlock.action, and
  wrapper.check.deadlock.output properties to configure the detection.
* (Professional) Add a new jvm_deadlock event which is fired in response to
  a thread deadlock being detected within the JVM.
* Fix a problem where the intervals like wrapper.ping.interval were all
  rounding down causing them to function at a rate one second shorter than
  configured.
* Fix a minor memory leak calling WrapperManager.exec.
* Add a new wrapper.filter.message.<n> property which can be used to control
  the message which is logged when a wrapper.filter.trigger.<n> is matched.
* Rework the way actions are fired for the wrapper.filter.<n>.action and
  wrapper.timer.<n>.action properties so there is no longer any duplicate
  code.
* Modify the way the wrapper.filter.<n>.action and wrapper.timer.<n>.action
  properties work so it is now possible to specify a list of actions which will
  happen in the order specified.  This makes it possible to do a thread dump
  and then restart in response to an error.
* Add the DEBUG action to the wrapper.filter.<n>.action property for
  consistency.
* (Professional) Implement the ability to fire user defined events as actions
  of the wrapper.filter.<n>.action, wrapper.timer.<n>.action, and
  wrapper.check.deadlock.action properties.
* Fix a problem in the WrapperProcess.destroy() function, when a child process
  couldn't have been forcibly killed.
* Add GetHosdID.bat file for Windows platforms. This file will open a dialog 
  displaying the HostId of the machine.
* Fix a problem in the shell script which, on a rc based OS, could lead to
  problems starting the Wrapper when the APP_NAME in the script contained
  capital letters.
* (Standard, Professional) Added a set of wrapper.share.<n>.* properties which
  makes it possible to configure the Wrapper to map specific network resources
  before launching the JVM on Windows.
* Corrected the way the Wrapper is installing itself as a Windows service when
  the binary and/or conf file are located on a Mapped Drive.
* Add new wrapper.pausable and wrapper.pausable.stop_jvm properties to control
  whether the JVM can be paused or not, and deprecate the use of the Windows
  specific wrapper.ntservice.pausable and wrapper.ntservice.pausable.stop_jvm
  properties.
* Modified the wrapper.commandfile property so PAUSE and RESUME commands are
  now supported on all platforms at any time.
* Modified the wrapper.filter.action.<n> property so PAUSE, RESUME, and DEBUG
  actions are now supported.
* (Professional) Modified the wrapper.timer.<n>.action property so PAUSE and
  RESUME actions are now supported.
* (Professional) Modified the wrapper.event.<event_name>.command.block.action
  property so PAUSE and RESUME actions are now supported.
* Added new WrapperServicePauseEvent and WrapperServiceResumeEvent classes to
  make it possible to notify an application that it has been paused or resumed.
  To date, this was only possible when the Windows service was paused or
  resumed
* (Professional) Add new "wrapper_pause" and "wrapper_resume" event types that
  are fired whenever the Wrapper is paused or resumed.
* Enhance the command line parsing for the WrapperManager.exec() command. The
  single commandLine version of the exec call will handle quotes more
  sophisticated.
* Modified the wrapper.syslog.ident property so its value is now silently
  trimmed to 32 characters in length.  This is needed to avoid problems with
  syslog servers.  (See RFC 3164 section 4.1.3)
* (Standard, Professional) Add new wrapper.syslog.remote.host,
  wrapper.syslog.remote.port, and wrapper.syslog.local.host properties which
  can be used to redirect all syslog (UNIX) or Event Log (Windows) output to
  a remote syslog server.
* Add support for the wrapper.syslog.facility property on Windows so remote
  syslog entries can be sent from Windows versions of the Wrapper.
* Add debug output from the WrapperManager class which shows information about
  the current wrapper.jar, including its size, location, and MD5 hash.
* Add a check for wrapper.java.classpath.<n> entries containing quotes.  The
  quotes are now stripped and a debug warning logged.
* (Standard, Professional) Increase the size of the wrapperw.exe error dialog
  so it is a little easier to read.  Also changed the font for the same reason.
* (Standard, Professional) Modify the title of the wrapperw.exe error dialog
  so it now includes the value of the wrapper.displayname property.
* Add a new check for the writability of the configured Java temporary
  directory.  When running on Vista, it will not be writable and can lead to
  errors.
* Added new wrapper.java.tmpdir.required and wrapper.java.tmpdir.warn_silently
  properties to control whether the temporary directory is required.
* Add a note in Wrapper conf template showing users how to configure a specific
  Java version to use.
* Add a new CLOSE_SOCKET command to the wrapper.commandfile property and added
  a new wrapper.commandfile.enable_tests property to control whether it can be
  used.
* Fix a debug warning while shutting down caused by one thread closing the
  backend socket when another expected it to be open.
* If the backend socket between the JVM and Wrapper is somehow closed, make the
  JVM respond promptly by restarting the JVM immediately to resync with the
  Wrapper.  Added log information to make it clear when this happens.
* Add a new wrapper.use_tick_mutex property to control whether or not the
  internal tick timer is protected by a mutex. (Experimental)
* (Standard, Professional) Add support for zLinux 32 and 64-bit on s390 and
  s390x systems.
* Change the internal encoding of the wrapper from native characters to
  UNICODE.  This will allow the wrapper to handle correctly any characters in
  its configuration file and internally.
* (Standard, Professional) Implement a new WrapperResources class which makes
  it possible for user applications to localize their applications using the
  same methods common to native applications.  The Wrapper uses this internally
  to provide localized versions of the Wrapper.
* Remove the old org.tanukisoftware.wrapper.resources package as it is no
  longer being used.
* (Standard, Professional) Add Japanese language pack to localize the Wrapper
  to Japanese.
* Fix a problem in the WrapperManager class where unexpected exceptions thrown
  in the main socket loop were being thrown away without being logged.
* Make the Wrapper more robust against failures removing the Wrapper's shutdown
  hook on shutdown.  It had been causing the clean shutdown of the JVM to fail
  as an unexpected exit.
* Fixed a problem in the wrapper customize code where customized multi layer
  icons may get scaled incorrectly by Windows.  Bug #3015848
* Modify the wrapper.on_exit.<n> property so it is now possible to PAUSE the
  Wrapper when a JVM exits.  This delays the restart of the JVM until the
  Wrapper is resumed.
* Add a new log format, 'U', which logs the approximate time in seconds since
  the Wrapper was launched.  It is based on the internal tick timer and will
  be a few percent lower than the actual number of seconds that have elapsed.
  Added to the wrapper.console.format, wrapper.logfile.format, and
  wrapper.logdialog.format properties.
* Fix a problem where deleting the configured anchor file was not recognized
  if the JVM was not running at the time.  The Wrapper was not noticing that
  it was missing until the next JVM was launched.
* (Standard, Professional) Add a new NOTICE log level which is used to log
  license related message.  These will only show up trial license log output.
* (Standard, Professional) Add a new default 15 minute trial license which
  can be used out of the box on any machine without the need to register and
  obtain a trial license or purchase a license.
* Add a new wrapper.environment.dump property which will dump all of the
  environment variables to the log, along with where the variables originated.
* Force the Wrapper to flush all logfile output for each line until the
  configuration file has been loaded.  There is normally no output up to this
  point anyway, but this ensures that any errors are logged in a consistent
  location.
* Move the registration of the main thread with the logging system up a bit
  to make it possible to perform low level debug logging earlier.
* Add a set of checks to display an error and prevent the Wrapper from starting
  if the batch or shell scripts being used are based on the TestWrapper demo
  application.  It is important that the user start with the default template
  files in the distribution src/bin and src/conf directories to make sure the
  integration goes smoothly.

3.4.1
* Fix a problem where the wrapper.app.parameter.1 property was always being
  set to an empty string when launched from launchd on Mac OSX.  It worked
  correctly with the testwrapper application, but would fail for most user
  applications.
* (Professional) Fix a potential synchronization problem in the log output
  of the tick timer, event command and event email code.  This had been in
  the code since 3.3.0 without any reports of problems.
* Improve the error message displayed when the configured wrapper.java.command
  can not be found on the path.
* Log the name of the signal in the logs when a SIGSEGV is detected from the
  JVM.   It had been logged as Unknown.
* Add some comments to the wrapper.conf.in template to help users get started
  with a new license key file.
* Add some default properties to the wrapper.conf.in template file to make
  it easier to get up and running with out of memory checks, as well as
  sending out alert emails.
* Add a small debug message when running wrapperw.exe so it is clear which
  wrapper binary is being used.
* Fix a problem where the wrapper.logfile.maxfiles was not being applied on
  startup when the current log file did not yet exist.  This was true for any
  wrapper.logfile value which contained a unique value like a PID.
* (Professional) Fix a problem in the WrapperProcess.destroy() function, where
  the function was failing to forcibly kill the child process.
* (Standard, Professional) Add a new GetHostID.bat file for Windows platforms.
  This file will open a dialog displaying the HostId of the machine to help
  new users get up and running.
* Add a new WrapperManager.appearOrphan() method which can be used to test
  how the WrapperManager shuts down the JVM in the event that the Wrapper
  process ever crashes or freezes.  This was not due to any particular problem
  and was added to fill out our test coverage.
* (Professional) Fix a problem where event commands were being left in a
  defunct state after execution on UNIX platforms.
* Fix a potential problem on 64-bit versions where the internal tick timer was
  not rolling over in the same way as the 32-bit versions.  This has been in all
  previous versions but is not known to have caused any problems.  It was fixed
  for consistency.
* Modify the WrapperManager class so it will now request a JVM hard exit only
  after 4-times the ping timeout, in seconds, since the last contact with the
  JVM.  This had been 90 seconds more than the ping timeout, which was not
  always long enough when the wrapper.ping.timeout was very large.
* Shift the initial start point of the tick counter so it will roll over 50
  seconds after startup.  This shouldn't be noticeable to the user, but makes
  sure that this roll over is much better tested as it always happens the first
  time on startup.
* Add a new wrapper.java.classpath.use_environment property which makes it
  possible to set the classpath using the CLASSPATH environment variable rather
  than including it on the Java command line.
* Fix a problem where requests to shutdown the Wrapper when in the state where
  it was just about to launch a JVM would being ignored.  This was fixed in all
  editions, but was only an issue in the Professional Edition when the
  wrapper.event.jvm_prelaunch.command.on_exit.<n>=SHUTDOWN property was being
  used with the wrapper.event.jvm_prelaunch.command.block=TRUE property and the
  command exited with a code that triggered the SHUTDOWN.
* (Professional) Add a new wrapper.event.<event_type>.command.block.action
  property to control how the Wrapper behaves when a command does not complete
  execution within the configured timeout.  Accepted values are CONTINUE, KILL,
  KILL_SHUTDOWN and KILL_RESTART.  Default value is CONTINUE.
* (Professional) Made it possible to use the "default" event type with the
  wrapper.event.<event_type>.command.loglevel,
  wrapper.event.<event_type>.command.block,
  wrapper.event.<event_type>.command.block.timeout,
  wrapper.event.<event_type>.command.on_exit.<n>, and
  wrapper.event.<event_type>.command.on_exit.default properties.
* Fixed a single byte buffer overflow which takes place just before the JVM is
  launched on Windows platforms.  This was introduced in 3.4.0.
* Add a message pointing the user to the Wrapper's log file when the service
  fails to start after it has been launched.
* Update the debug message displayed when attempting to open the backend socket
  if the port is unavailable so it doesn't seem like a problem.  It will retry
  with another port.
* Work around an issue on some Solaris problems where the shell script would fail
  if /usr/ucb/ps wasn't installed.
* Fix a problem on UNIX versions where the Wrapper would fail to resolve the
  correct location of java if it was located using the system PATH, and that PATH
  element pointed to a binary via a relative symbolic link.  This was introduced
  in 3.4.0.

3.4.0
* Increased the minimum supported Java version from 1.2 to 1.4.
* Removed the reflection code used to manage the Wrapper's shutdown hook.
  The Runtime methods are now called normally.
* Add a note in the TestWrapper shell script to make it clear that the user
  should always use the scripts in the WRAPPER_HOME/src/bin/ directory when
  generating scripts for their own applications.  This became more of an
  issue because of changes to the TestWrapper script starting with 3.3.8.
  Bug #2902843.
* (Professional) Added new WrapperManager.exec methods and a new
  WrapperProcess class to allow the launching and management of child
  processes through the Wrapper rather than using the standard Runtime
  class.  This makes it possible to clean up child processes when the
  JVM crashes or is restarted, as well as solves severe memory issues with
  the way processes are forked on some UNIX platforms.
* (Professional) Added a new wrapper.child.status.loglevel property to make
  it easier to debug the status of child processes.
* (Professional) Added a new wrapper.child.count.interval property to control
  the interval at which the number of waiting child processes is logged after
  a JVM is shutdown.
* (Professional) Added a new wrapper.jvm_cleanup.timeout property to control
  the amount of time that managed child processes still running after the JVM
  has exited are given to shutdown before being forcibly killed.
* Fix a problem with WrapperManager.getUser() and getInteractiveUser() methods
  which was preventing us from using the latest compiler on 32-bit Windows.
  (The compiler used to build 32-bit Windows versions was rolled back to the
  version used through the 3.3.5 release in 3.3.9 to work around the problem
  that was causing these methods to always return null.)  The change in this
  version should not affect how the Wrapper functions.
* The old compiler used in 3.3.9 for Windows 32-bit builds was causing a false
  hit on Symantec security software.  The new compiler causes the Wrapper to
  once again pass without any warnings.
* Added a warning while starting up the JVM which will be displayed if the
  Java command in wrapper.java.command does not point to a valid java binary 
  file.
* [Changed the scripts and batch files to try to load the wrapper executable
  according to the system, i.e. on 64-bit systems the 64bit binary of the 
  wrapper is attempted to be executed first and after this fails the 32 bit 
  gets attempted to be loaded. This behaviour is primaly useful with the 
  delta-pack of the wrapper.]
* Add some debug output logging the current timezone to assist supporting
  time related problems.
* (Standard, Professional) Added a new wrapper.license.debug property which
  will log information about the license key(s) being tested on startup.
* (Standard, Professional) Fix a problem where license validation was
  failing at certain times of the day for servers with timezones east of
  Japan.  Development license keys which have their update times obfuscated
  were not affected.  This was a problem introduced in 3.3.7.
* Fixed a bug in the wrapper shell script which occurred when running the script
  on a Solaris within a non singlebyte locale. Bug #2910327
* Fixed a potential bug in the wrapper script where requesting a Thread Dump,
  the shell is sending the wrapper console to the background and returning 
  with a prompt.
* Fix a problem where Java log output would sometimes get extra line feeds
  when under heavy load.
* Fix a problem which was leading to a resource not found error when trying
  to start a service, if it was installed on a Mapped Network Drive under 
  Windows.
* Added some advice messages recommending the use of UNC paths if a resource
  located on a Mapped Network Drive is used in the configuration file on
  Windows versions.
* (Standard, Professional) Fix a bug in the wrapper binary customization,
  which occurred when the source binary file was set to read only. 
* Fixed a null string problem in the error message if a classpath value 
  wasn't found.
* (Professional) Added the option to include a logfile into the wrapper's 
  EmailNotification mails via wrapper.event.default.attach_log=TRUE
* Improve the message displayed when a user calls
  WrapperManager.requestThreadDump() in JVM which does not have console
  window on Windows.  This should never be an issue when run with the Wrapper,
  but can happen if running standalone without the wrapper binary.
* Update the Windows batch scripts so they now take AMD64 and IA64
  architectures into account when deciding which version of the Wrapper to
  run when using the delta pack.
* Update the UNIX shell script so it now does a much better job of resolving
  the ideal platform bits to run the correct version of the Wrapper when using
  the delta pack.  Thanks to Leo Leung for the patch.
* Add install and remove commands to the UNIX shell script so it is now much
  easier to install and remove the Wrapper on many UNIX plattforms to start
  and stop on system startup and shutdown.  Thanks to Leo Leung for the patch.
* Update the Windows batch scripts so it is now easier to change the location
  of the Wrapper configuration file or rename the Wrapper binary when using
  the scripts.
* Added a new QueryApp-NT.bat.in template script which can be used to query
  the current running status of the service on Windows.
* (Standard, Professional) Add a new "-u" or "--update" command to the Wrapper
  which allows you to effectively reinstall the Wrapper as a service without
  having to provide the account credentials if the service is running as a
  specific user.  This is very useful for installers upgrading an application
  to a new version.
* Add a new "update" command to the Windows AppCommand.bat.in batch script.
* Go through and clean up the messages displayed when controlling the Wrapper
  as a service so the messages are consistent and more meaningful to the user.
* Add wrapper.wait_for_hostid and wrapper.max_hostid_timeout property. 
  This properties set if and how long the wrapper shall wait when starting up 
  until the hostid is available.  This is important to make sure that server
  licenses are validated correctly on UNIX platforms as the OS is booting up.
* (Professional) Fix a problem where environment variables referenced in
  property values were not being expanded correctly the first time they were
  referenced if the property's value was a default value.  The underlying fix
  was in all editions, but this was only causing a problem in the Professional
  Edition where the WRAPPER_HOSTNAME variable was not being expanded in the
  subject and body of emails sent out for the "wrapper_start" event if the
  defaults were used.
* (Professional) Fix a problem where backslashes in the body of emails,
  configured with the wrapper.event.<event_name>.email.body property, were
  not being handled correctly when displaying things like paths from
  environment variable references.
* Fix a problem on UNIX platforms where the Wrapper was displaying an error
  about not being able to locate the configuration file when the Wrapper was
  run without any arguments.
* (Standard, Professional) Improve the message shown when a License Key is not
  found.
* Add a new message to the Community Edition when the user requests a HostId.
* Add WAIT_FOR_STARTED_STATUS and WAIT_FOR_STARTED_TIMEOUT to the script. This
  lets the script wait (up to timeout sec.) when starting a daemonized process
  until the process has been started.
  Thanks to Dobes V.  Feature Requests #2917391.
* Improve the error message displayed when the user tries to run the Wrapper
  with the internal -s or --service commands.
* Fix a problem where the WrapperSystemPropertyUtil.getBooleanValue() method
  was not correctly returning the specified default value when the looked up
  property was missing.  Also added a new getStringValue() method.
* Improve the error message displayed when the user tries to install and remove
  the wrapper as Service on Windows Versions after Windows Vista.
* Add an advice message when MacOSX applications launched with launchd
  encounter a "Returning nil _server" error when displaying a GUI.

3.3.9
* Modify the way JNI functions are called from within the native library so
  they work correctly on platforms which are not ASCII based.
* (Professional) Add support for IBM z/OS 390 servers.  This is still an alpha
  release and will be made available on request.
* Improve the message displayed when a server license key is used on a
  different server.
* Add a minimum max file size of 1024 bytes to the wrapper.logfile.maxsize
  property to avoid the log file rotating too often if the user enters a
  very small value.
* Add a message that shows up in the console when the Wrapper fails to write
  to the configured log file.  As with previous versions, it will then fall
  back to writing to wrapper.log in the current working directory.
* On UNIX platforms, automatically set the wrapper.disable_console_input
  property when wrapper.daemonize is set.
* Fix a problem introduced in 3.3.8 where relative configuration file includes
  were failing to resolve correctly when the wrapper.working.dir and
  wrapper.daemonize properties were used together.  The wrapper.daemonize
  property causes the configuration to be loaded twice on startup and the
  working directly was not being reset correctly before it was loaded the
  second time.
* Fix a problem introduced in 3.3.8 where wildcard selection of files on
  Windows failed in some cases.
* Fix a problem introduced in 3.3.8 where setting the wrapper.logfile.maxfiles
  property to 0 was causing all log files to be deleted rather than none when
  the ROLLNUM file pattern was used.
* Revert the way rolled log files are deleted when using the ROLLNUM file
  pattern to the functionality used in versions 3.3.7 and earlier.  Files such
  as wrapper.log.bak or other files manually created with the same log file
  base name were also being deleted with 3.3.8.
* (Standard, Professional) Fix a problem where the close window button in the
  title of the WrapperW log dialog was not correctly cancelling the dialog.
* (Standard, Professional) Fix a problem where the WrapperW log dialog would
  sometimes fail to show itself on top of other windows if the splashscreen
  had been displayed on startup.
* Fix a problem on 32-bit Windows versions where starting with he Wrapper,
  the WrapperManager.getUser() and getInteractiveUser() methods were always
  returning null.  This problem was introduced in version 3.3.6.
* (Professional) Fix a buffer overflow when sending alert emails to multiple
  addresses.  This would sometimes cause crashes in versions 3.3.7 and 3.3.8
  when sending alert emails to even a single recipient.  Because of the nature
  of the overflow, in most cases did not cause any problems.

3.3.8
* Add the new start type DELAY_START for NT Services, which startes the service 
  after other auto-start services are started plus a short delay.
* Fix a problem where the Wrapper's PID file was not being set to the correct
  PID when the wrapper was launched daemonized.  With the shell scripts that
  ship with the Wrapper, this means that it would not be possible to stop the
  Wrapper using the script because the expected PID did not exist.  This was
  a problem introduced in 3.3.7.
* Changed the timing for the wrapper's splashscreen when the splash screen 
  mode was set to JVM_STARTING. Now the splashscreen will disappear when the 
  JVM has been initialized.
* Fix a problem where the splashscreen was being shown when starting a service
  or performing other command line operations.
* Remove some extra debug output on startup for Mac versions.
* Fix a crash in the Community Edition on PPC platforms of the Mac OSX version.
  This crash has been reproduced in all versions starting with 3.3.1.  The OSX
  distribution is a universal binary but does not appear to result in a crash
  on x86 servers.  Standard and Professional Editions were not affected.
* Fix a problem on Windows versions where problems accessing the registry were
  not reporting the correct error message.  This did not cause any problems in
  and of itself, but it made it difficult to track the down the cause.
* When wildcards are used in the classpath elements, the list of matching jar
  files included in the classpath are now sorted to ensure that their order
  is consistent across installations.  Normally it would not matter, but if
  certain classes or resources are redefined in multiple jars this will ensure
  that the application now always works the same.
* Fix a problem where wrapper.logfile.maxfiles was being ignored when
  wrapper.logfile.rollmode=JVM was set.
* Changed the way the wrapper.logfile.maxfiles property works with the ROLLNUM
  token.  Now when the log files are rolled, all files greater than maxfiles
  count will be deleted.  Previously, the Wrapper would roll within the maxfiles
  count and ignore extra files if they existed.  This would cause extra files to
  be left around if the maxfiles property value was decreased.
* Add new wrapper.logfile.purge.pattern and wrapper.logfile.purge.sort
  properties which make it possible to limit the number of log files in some
  advanced cases.  Be sure to read the documentation before playing with them.
* Fix a potential crash when referencing non-existent environment variables
  in the value of wrapper.logfile.
* Modify the way all properties used to define file names behave so that
  undefined environment variable references will now have their '%' characters
  replaced by '_'.  This is to avoid problems caused by file names containing
  '%' characters on some platforms.
* Fix a problem introduced in 3.3.6 where the windows shown by the JVM or its
  child processes could not be displayed when running in iteractive mode.
* Rework the TestWrapper application a bit so it can now be run in headless
  mode for testing.
* Fix a problem on some UNIX platforms where the shell script was showing an
  extra '-n' when run with the "start" command.
* Fix a problem for FreeBSD which could cause the wrapper being unable to stop
  the wrapper daemon if the ps command buffer size (kern.ps_arg_cache_limit) 
  was too small to contain the wrapper command line.

3.3.7
* (Professional and Standard) Added the ability to customize the wrapper.exe
  and wrapperw.exe binaries on Windows with a user specified icon and splash
  screen.
* (Professional and Standard) Added a new wrapper.splashscreen.mode property
  to control how long the splashscreen is visible.
* Fix a problem on SELinux where a strict security policy could lead the
  Wrapper fail to load the libwrapper library.  Thanks to Jean for the hint.
* Fixed a problem in the obfuscated license date, which caused a license to
  be reported as invalid if run in a timezone west of Japan.  This feature
  was implemented in 3.3.6, but disabled on the site until the release of
  version 3.3.7.  Thanks to Leo for the hint.
* Added a new WRAPPER_PID environment variable. Feature Request #2870136.
* Added a new WrapperManager.getWrapperLogFile() method and
  WrapperLogFileChangedEvent class that can be used to receive notifications
  of changes to the Wrapper log file currently in use.
  Feature Request #2870133.
* (Professional) Improved the wrapper.event.<event_name>.email.to property
  so it now supports the ability to specify multiple recipients.

3.3.6
* Introduce the wrapper.timezone property. This property allows to set the
  timezone in which the wrapper will be executed. This property is available 
  in the standard and the professional Edition of the Java Service Wrapper.
* Fix a potential problem on Windows platforms where a failure to register the
  control handler was not being logged.  If this happened, user logoffs would
  not be trapped correctly but no other problems would have occurred.
* Fixed a problem in the shell script on Solaris platforms where a deep
  directory structure would cause the script to incorrectly report that the
  Wrapper was not running.  That could lead to multiple zombie copies of the
  Wrapper and its application running in memory.
  Bug #1664303.
* Fixed a problem in the shell script on HP-UX platforms where a deep
  directory structure would cause the script to incorrectly report that the
  Wrapper was not running.  That could lead to multiple zombie copies of the
  Wrapper and its application running in memory.
  Bug #2812207.
* Improve the error message displayed when there are problems initializing the
  main class specified for the WrapperSimpleApp, WrapperStartStopApp, or
  WrapperJarApp helper classes.
* (Professional) Add new wrapper.event.<event_name>.loglevel and
  wrapper.event.<event_name>.message properties which can be used to output
  a customizable message like "Event: <event_name>" to the logs at an arbitrary
  log level.
* Add debug output in the Windows version to log the full path of the native
  library.
* Add a new wrapper.java.detect_debug_jvm property which will control whether
  or not the Wrapper disabled timeouts when java's debugger is in use.  The
  Wrapper has automatically disabled timeouts in this case since version 3.2.1.
  Thanks to Ruslan Gainutdinov for the patch.
* Fix a buffer overflow problem for values of wrapper.ntservice.name.
* Fix a problem with where the wrapper.syslog.ident property was not working
  as documented.  It had been necessary to use wrapper.ntservice.name in its
  place.
* Add a new wrapper.ignore_sequence_gaps property which makes it possible to
  have non sequential numbered property values.  This affects the
  wrapper.app.parameter.<n>, wrapper.event.<event_name>.command.argv.<n>,
  wrapper.filter.trigger.<n>, wrapper.java.additional.<n>,
  wrapper.java.classpath.<n>, wrapper.java.library.path.<n>,
  wrapper.ntservice.dependency.<n>, and wrapper.timer.<n>.interval, 
  properties.  The default value maintains past functionality.
  Feature Request #1930298.
* (Professional) Fix a problem where the Event Handler Variables
  were not being set correctly in the values of the
  wrapper.event.<event_name>.command.argv.<n> properties.
* (Professional) Fix a potential access violation if memory allocations fail
  while sending event mails or executing event commands.
* Add a new WRAPPER_HOSTNAME default environment variable as an alias of the
  existing WRAPPER_HOST_NAME variable.
* (Professional) Deprecate the use of the wrapper.event.<event_name>.set_environment
  property.  It will remain in the product for compatibility but its use is
  discouraged as it does not always work correctly when the configuration
  file is reloaded.  See the property's documentation for more details.
* Add a new DUMP action to the wrapper.filter.action.<n> property to make it
  possible to invoke a thread dump in response to a specific string in the
  JVM's console output.
* Fix a problem where the WrapperManager.stopAndReturn method was dead locking
  if called when the JVM was being run in standalone mode without the Wrapper.
  Bug #2711872.
* (Standard, Professional) Modify the way the licensing times work so the
  Wrapper compares the License Upgrade Term to an official release date
  rather than the build date.  This makes it possible to release additional
  platforms at a later date while keeping the use of a license consistent.
* (Standard, Professional) Make it possible to obfuscate the upgrade term in
  License Key files for development licenses so it is not visible to an end
  user what the development license holder's upgrade term is.  This feature
  is accessed from the License Management Page when downloading a new or
  existing License Key file.


3.3.5
* Fix a problem on some UNIX platforms introduced in 3.3.4 where the Wrapper
  would crash on startup if the configured JVM could not be found.
* Fix a problem introduced in 3.3.2 where the Wrapper could crash if the
  system host name was longer than 27 characters in length.
* Fix a potential problem with the way thread ids were being compared on UNIX
  systems.
* Add a new wrapper.java.additional.auto_bits property which will automatically
  add the -d32 or -d64 arguments to the JVM for platforms whose JVMs typically
  expect the argument.
* (Professional) Fix a problem with the Date field of outgoing event emails.

3.3.4
* (Standard, Professional) Update the development license to version 1.1
  so that a new copyright notice file can be shipped with user applications
  rather than the full license text.
* The Community Edition may be licensed under either the GPL2 based Community
  License, or the Development License.  The source for the Standard and
  Professional Editions of the Wrapper are proprietary.
  http://wrapper.tanukisoftware.org/doc/english/licenseOverview.html
* Fix a problem introduced in 3.3.2 where querying a the status of a Windows
  service with the -q or -qs commands resulted in an access violation.  The
  running status of the service was reported correctly but additional
  configuration information was failing.  Bug #2644515.
* Add a new wrapper.disable_restarts.automatic property to disable only
  restarts caused by JVM timeouts, crashes, etc.  Manual or configured
  restarts will still be allowed.
* Switch to using make for HPUX IA 32/64 builds.
* Add Advice comments when the Wrapper fails to launch the JVM process.
* Fix a problem on UNIX platforms where log entries made by the forked Wrapper
  process would result in two blocks of log entries in the log file because
  the parent Wrapper process would think they were console output from the JVM
  process.
* Add a set of new wrapper environment variables that can be referenced in the
  wrapper.conf file to generate random numbers, or timestamps for use in
  generating unique file names, etc. See the Default Environment Variable
  definitions section for more details.
* (Standard, Professional) Fix a problem with Development licenses being
  able to authorize applications using Integration Method #4 which was
  added in version 3.3.3.
* Add the number of bits of the current Wrapper to the startup banner to aid
  in support requests.
* (Standard, Professional) Fix a crash problem on HPUX versions which would
  reliably happen on some machines at startup.

3.3.3
* Modify the wrapper.ignore_signals property so it now takes the values
  WRAPPER, JAVA, and BOTH, in addition to TRUE and FALSE.
* Modify the WrapperManager so it is now careful never to poll the native
  library once the JVM is flagged as being ready to shutdown.  This is to
  make sure that the JVM never exits in the middle of a call as that could
  lead to the JVM crashing.
* Add a pair of methods to allow threads to request and release locks which
  will prevent the Wrapper from letting the JVM exit while certain operations
  are in progress.  See WrapperManager.requestShutdownLock() and
  WrapperManager.releaseShutdownLock().
* Fix a problem where interactive services would sometimes leave a console
  window visible when after starting up.  The Wrapper is now more resilient
  about closing the window even if it fails to do so initially.
* Add a new integration method (#4), which makes it easy to configure the
  Wrapper to execute an executable jar file.
* Fix a problem where the random generator was not being seeded correctly
  before naming the Wrapper's console window when running as a Windows
  service.  This was leading to problems identifying the wrapper's console
  when more than one service was running on the same machine.

3.3.2
* Add a file information record to the wrapper.exe and wrapperw.exe binaries
  so the Version tab will be displayed correctly in the Properties dialog of
  the file.
* (Standard, Professional) Fix a problem with the wrapperw.exe binary where
  the log dialog was not being displayed correctly when the Wrapper was
  launched with the "-?", "-v", or "-h" arguments.
* (Standard, Professional) Fix a problem with the wrapperw.exe binary where
  a message was being displayed in the dialog with the location of the full
  log file even if there had not been any entries written to the log.
* (Professional) Improve the debug output produced when sending event emails
  when the wrapper.event.<event_name>.email.debug property enabled.
* (Professional) Add wrapper.event.<event_name>.email.send.timeout and
  wrapper.event.<event_name>.email.receive.timeout properties to avoid the
  wrapper hanging waiting for a response from a remote mail server.
  Bug #2064885.
* (Professional) Fix a problem where the Wrapper would get stuck and fail to
  send emails with some mail servers.  Problems was being caused by incorrect
  linefeeds in the body of the email.
* Add a warning if the leading '#' is missing from an '#include' in the
  configuration file to assist users with include file problems.
* Added a new wrapper.ntservice.generate_console property which will cause
  the Wrapper to always generate a console when running as a service and
  then hide it immediately.  This will cause a slight flicker but is needed
  to support thread dumps.  Bug #2060181.
* Fix a problem in the Windows version where the console window would
  sometimes be left visible when running as an interactive service even when
  it was configured to be hidden.
* Add support for PowerEvents so Windows services can respond to suspend
  and resume events.
* Fix a problem where the wrapper.key system property passed to the JVM was
  being generated incorrectly randomly, 1 in 2048 times the JVM was launched.
  This would result in the JVM failing to start and the Wrapper shutting down.
* Add a new wrapper.disable_console_input to disable to feature which allows
  the Wrapper to pass console input on to the Java process.
* Fix a buffer overflow problem in the logging code which would happen once on
  startup.  This was benign on most platforms but was causing intermittent
  crashes in the 32-bit AIX version.
* Modify the way configuration properties are parsed so that their names are
  no longer case sensitive.
* Modify the WrapperServiceException so that a new getErrorCode method can be
  used to obtain the integer error code which caused the exception.
  Feature Request #2188280.
* (Standard, Professional) Fix a problem where on some Windows machines the
  Wrapper would return a random hostId that changed each time the system was
  rebooted.
* (Standard, Professional) Make it possible to define License Keys so that
  their property names are encoded using either the host name or hostId.  This
  makes it possible to define multiple keys within the same configuration file,
  visible on the same host.  This was necessary to support some load balanced
  network adapters where the visible hostId changes depending on the active
  physical network adapter.
* Rework the Java side state engine so it is now possible for the Java side of
  the Wrapper to respond to stop events while the WrapperListener.start method
  is still in progress.
* Add a new wrapper.listener.force_stop property which allows control over
  whether the WrapperListener.stop method is called on shutdown even if the
  WrapperListener.start method has not yet completed.
* Fix a problem on Windows where the ability to start and stop the Wrapper as
  a service using the Wrapper itself was requiring the Administrator permission
  when a lower permission should have been possible.  The Wrapper should now
  allow service control to do whatever is possible from the Services control
  panel.
* Fix a memory corruption error if the value of wrapper.java.maxmemory was more
  than 4 digits in length.  wrapper.java.initmemory did not have any problems.
* (Professional) Add a new wrapper.event.<event_name>.email.client.host
  property which makes it possible to configure the host name sent in EHLO and
  HELO commands to the SMTP server.
* Add a new default environment variable, WRAPPER_HOST_NAME, which stores the
  name of the machine where the Wrapper is running.

3.3.1
* Add debug output showing the current os name and architecture to aid in
  debugging problems.
* (Standard, Professional) Improve the message displayed when a license key
  is found but is deemed to be invalid.
* Modify the template wrapper.conf file to help users debug include file
  problems.
* Disable the console title feature on all UNIX platforms other than LINUX
  because the console title does not get reset correctly when the Wrapper
  process terminates.
* Add support for HP-UX IA64 CPUs.
* Update the license banner in source files so it is clearer that the user
  is restricted by the license they agreed to.
* Modify the Community edition so it will now display a Licensed to banner
  on startup if shipped with a Development License.  This is required to
  enable the distribution of the Community Edition under the Development
  License.
* (Professional) Fix a problem where the UNIX versions of the Professional
  Edition would sometimes deadlock on startup when run as a daemon process.
  Bug #1989355.
* (Professional) Added two new events; jvm_failed_invocation and
  jvm_max_failed_invocations.  Feature Request #1994718.
* Fix a problem where the Windows service exit code was not being set
  correctly when the JVM exited with a non-zero exit code.  The problem
  could be seen by running "sc query {service}" from the command line.
  Bug #1859061.
* Added support for the Windows Itanium 64-bit platform.
* Added support for the HP-UX Itanium 32 and 64-bit platforms.
* Added support for the MAC OSX 64-bit platform.
* (Standard, Professional) Fix a problem on Windows versions where servers
  which reported a large number of possible host ids could cause a buffer
  overflow on startup.   This crash was possible when using either
  Development or Server licenses.  Removed duplicate host ids from the list
  of possible ids.
* Add a new "condrestart" command to the shell script which will restart
  the Wrapper only if it is already running.  Feature Request #1928045.
* Fix a problem where the 64-bit Solaris x86 version was unable to load its
  JNI library.  Bug #1992039.
* Fix a problem on Windows versions where a frozen JVM process was not always
  being killed.  This could result in the zombie JVM processes being left
  around that consumed memory and other resources.
* Add a new wrapper.ignore_console_logouts property which allows the Wrapper
  and JVM to survive logouts when launched as a console application from
  another service.
* (Standard, Professional) Add a wrapperw.exe binary in Windows implementations
  which makes it possible to run the Wrapper without a console.  A console still
  flickers for an instant when the Wrapper starts.  This is the same issue that
  has existed when running as an interactive service and is required to make
  thread dumping possible.
* (Standard, Professional) Add new wrapper.logdialog.enable,
  wrapper.logdialog.format, wrapper.logdialog.lines, and
  wrapper.logdialog.loglevel properties used to configure the display of a Log
  dialog when the wrapperw.exe binary exits in an error state.
* Fix a problem where the Wrapper was attempting to reopen its backend port
  even when the JVM was down.  This was only a problem when the defined port
  range was limited to a single port with the wrapper.port.min and
  wrapper.port.max properties.  In such a case one or more warning messages
  were being displayed because the port is locked for a few moments after
  being closed.
* (Standard, Professional) The wrapper.initmemory.percent and
  wrapper.maxmemory.percent properties were not correctly being calculated
  relative to a maximum of 2048MB for 32-bit versions of the Wrapper.
  Bug #2053167.

3.3.0
* Add a new wrapper.ping.interval.logged property which makes it possible to
  reduce the debug output caused by ping transactions between the Wrapper and
  JVM.
* Fix a problem on Windows where the Windows Service Manager was not waiting
  the full configured time of the wrapper.jvm_exit.timeout and
  wrapper.shutdown.timeout properties.  This was leading to the net stop
  command timing out and the system shutting down without the java application
  having fully stopped.  Bug #1582568.
* If internal firewalls were preventing the backend socket from being created,
  it was not being made clear what the cause was.  It was also possible that
  the JVM would deadlock on shutdown.  This second problem was recovered from
  when the Wrapper killed the JVM.
* Rework the console output from all Wrapper classes to make it much more
  obvious that that is their source.
* Submit a patch to the UNIX sh script by Chris Dance which makes it possible
  to tell the shell to wait a few seconds for the wrapper to start up.  Also
  includes some modifications to work correctly on older Debian and RedHat
  systems.
* Fix a problem where the local copy of ant was not always being used
  correctly on UNIX systems which have a default copy of any installed.
  Thanks to Robey Pointer for the patch.
* Add the -lm to the command line when building Linux 32 and 64 bit versions
  of the wrapper on Linux.  This is to support building on recent Debian
  and Ubuntu versions.  Thanks to Robey Pointer for the patch.
* Add support for the SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 signals so they can now trigger a
  shutdown, restart or be forwarded to the JVM for custom functionality.
  See the wrapper.signal.mode.usr1 and wrapper.signal.mode.usr2 properties.
  Based on a patch by Robey Pointer.  Note that the JVM process does not
  trap SIGUSR1 or SIGUSR2 signals as they are used internally by the JVM
  as part of the garbage collection process.
* Fix a problem where the WRAPPER_OS, WRAPPER_ARCH, and WRAPPER_BITS
  environment variables were not being initialized correctly for the various
  unix platforms.
* Removed the 4096Mb upper limit set on the wrapper.java.initmemory and
  wrapper.java.maxmemory properties.  64bit users need to go way beyond that.
* Fix a problem where relative include file references in the configuration
  file were not working correctly if the wrapper.working.dir was used to
  change the working directory.  The working directory is now always reset
  to its original value as the configuration file is being loaded.
* Added a new wrapper.registry.java_home property which makes it
  possible to specify the location of java within the registry.
* Set a new WRAPPER_JAVA_HOME environment variable if the JAVA_HOME is
  located in the Windows registry.
* Modify the way properties are looked up so that any unreplaced environment
  variable references will be reevaluated in case they were set after the
  property was originally set.  This is possible with some WRAPPER_*
  environment variables or depending on the placement of set.* properties
  in the configuration file.
* Set any unset properties to their default values internally.  This is
  necessary so the WrapperManager.getProperties() method returns the
  correct set of active properties.
* Fix an occasional crash with 64-bit UNIX caused by a native synchronization
  problem when system signals are trapped.  Bug #1614010.
* Fix a problem on Solaris versions, where the Wrapper was not correctly
  recovering and attempting another back end port when the first was already
  in use.  Bug #1594073.
* Fix a problem on Solaris and AIX where the RUN_AS_USER feature of the
  shell script was not working due to lack of support for the "-m" option of
  su.  The shell script now uses "su -".  Bug #1590168.
* Add HP-UX Makefiles for building with make.  Fix some problems in the
  shell script to make the script work better on HP-UX.  Thanks to David
  Brown and Nicolas Varney for the patches.
* Fix a problem where any signals received by the JVM and triggering a
  SIGCHLD signal in the Wrapper were being interpretted as the JVM having
  stopped.  This was not always true.  Bug #1643666.
* The Wrapper is now able to detect when the JVM process is stopped and
  continued.  It will still timeout if stopped, but a descriptive warning
  is now logged.
* Increase the maximum number of log entries which can be queued to avoid
  losing them.  These are only used for log entries outside of the primary
  thread.
* Fix a problem in the shell script which was making it impossible to stop
  the Wrapper or query its status on OSX.
* Add support for 64 bit AIX.  Thanks to Nicolas Varney for supplying a
  Makefile.
* Correct the AIX library extension to be ".a".
* Rename the UNIX Makefiles so it is more obvious which tool must be used
  to build with them.
* Fix a problem where the HP-UX native library would not be located
  correctly for some processor types if the file had a platform specific
  name.
* Internally rename the WRAPPER_JSTATE_LAUNCH state to
  WRAPPER_JSTATE_LAUNCH_DELAY for clarity.
* Fix a problem where the UNIX versions of the Wrapper would shutdown
  rather than restarting a frozen JVM if the arrival of the SIGCHLD signal
  from the old JVM process was delayed by more than a second or two.
* Rework the Windows build so it now uses nmake and a Makefile rather than
  vcbuild.  This is probably not as clean, but it was needed to get the
  64-bit build working.
* Fix a problem on Windows versions where quoted values specified from the
  command line were not always being requoted correctly when generating the
  java command line.
* Add validation checks for Windows versions to make sure that all additional
  parameters, application arguments, the classpath, and library path all
  contain values which are quoted correctly.  Incorrectly quoted values will
  now result in a warning message that will help resolve the problem.
* Fix a memory leak when calling WrapperManager.listServices() on Windows.
  Bug #1665947.
* Fix a buffer overflow problem if the Wrapper was launched without explicitly
  specifying a configuration file.
* Add tests of the return values of all malloc calls to catch out of memory
  errors and recover as gracefully as possible.  Bug #1649880.
* Modify the WrapperManager.signalStarting and signalStopping methods so that
  they will never have the effect of shortening the existing timeout.
  Updated the javadocs of both methods so they more accurately reflect what
  the methods do.
* Move the Wrapper Copyright banner into the Wrapper process so it will be
  output more consistently.
* Branch the code to support Community, Standard, and Professional Editions
  of the Java Service Wrapper.
* (Standard, Professional) Add support for Server (Fixed) as well as
  Development (OEM based) licenses.
* (Standard, Professional) Add 64-bit versions of the Windows version.  The
  64-bit Community Edition will not be distributed initially to support
  ongoing development costs.
* (Professional) Add event handling callbacks for Wrapper start/stop, JVM
  start/stop, JVM started/stopped, JVM restart, JVM killed, and JVM unexpected
  exit events.
* (Professional) Add the ability to send emails in response to any event
  callback.
* (Professional) Add the ability to execute a a user configured command in
  response to any event callback.
* Add WRAPPER_BIN_DIR and WRAPPER_WORKING_DIR environment variables which are
  now available for use within the wrapper.conf file as well as by any child
  processes.
* Add documentation to the integration pages about existing system properties
  that be used to control the way the WrapperSimpleApp and WrapperStartStopApp
  handle application startup.
* Remove support for native PPC and x86 distributions of the Wrapper for
  MAC OSX in favor of the universal X-Code distribution.  This appears to be
  the standard for the market and saves lots of time on testing.
* Add a new '-it' command to the Windows version which makes it possible to
  install and start a service as a single command.
* Fix a problem where the PATH environment variable was not being set correctly
  on Windows versions when run as a service if the wrapper.ntservice.account
  was set and a PATH was set for both the SYSTEM and user accounts.
  Bug #1702274.
* Modify the shell script to set JAVA_HOME to the default JVM location on
  OSX systems if it is not already set.  OSX always places the JVM in a known
  location so this is possible.  Thanks to Andrew Williams for the patch.
* Fix a problem where the UNIX shell script would fail if the APP_NAME was set
  to a value containing spaces.  Thanks to Andrew Williams for the patch.
  Bug #1695678.
* Fix a problem where the DIST_ARCH was not being resolved correctly on HP-UX
  systems.  Thanks to Matej Kraus for the patch.  Patch #1697421.
* Log output from the timer thread was not being queued correctly, this could
  have lead to timing problems if there were any delays writing to disk.
* Add partial support for OS/400 into the build file.  Still needs a Makefile.
* Fix a problem where the WrapperActionServer would deadlock in its stop method
  if the JVM shutdown was initiated by a call to the shutdown or restart
  actions.
* Add support for wrapper.console.title on UNIX platforms.  Add a set of
  wrapper.console.title.<platform> properties which make it possible to set the
  title based on the platform.
* Fix a problem where the wrapper.ntservice.account and
  wrapper.ntservice.password properties were being stored in the system
  registry if the they were specified on the command line when the Wrapper
  was installed as a service.  This was broken in version 3.2.2.
  Bug #1538725.
* Fix a problem where the DUMP command was not working with the
  wrapper.commandfile property when run as a service on Windows.
  Bug #1644421.
* Fix a problem where wildcards like "*.*" or "*" in a classpath property were
  including the "." and ".." files on Windows versions.  Bug #1517928.
* Modify the debug log output when the Wrapper is attempting to load its native
  library in an attempt to make the expected failures less threatening.
* Commit a patch by Rob Oxspring which adds the start_msg and stop_msg commands
  to the shell script.  These are expected by init scripts on HP-UX.
  Patch #1750027.
* Add a DETAIL_STATUS flag to the UNIX shell script which will cause the
  status, start_msg, and stop_msg commands to display the current internal
  status of both the Wrapper and Java processes.
* Commit a patch by Rob Oxspring which adds an init block to the UNIX shell
  script to make it work with install_initd and remove_initd scripts used by
  SUSE linux.  Patch #1750028.
* Commit a patch by Travis Carlson, ia64 systems were being grouped as "x86"
  systems.  They now are assigned the name "ia" which makes it possible to
  create a distribution for them.  Patch #1663887.
* (Standard, Professional) Add new wrapper.java.initmemory.percent and
  wrapper.java.maxmemory.percent properties which make it possible to set
  the initial and maximum memory values relative to the amount of physical
  memory on the system.  Feature Request #1741051.
* Add a new #include.debug declaration in the wrapper configuration file which
  makes it much easier to debug problems with cascading include files.
* Add -l and --controlcode commands to the Windows version which make it easy
  to send user defined control codes to the Wrapper running as a service.
* Fix a synchronization problem in the logging code which could result in
  data corruption or access violations.
* Add version numbers to the bat and sh scripts to make them easier to
  support.
* Make the wrapper.ntservice.name, wrapper.ntservice.displayname, and
  wrapper.ntservice.description properties aliases of new wrapper.name,
  wrapper.displayname, and wrapper.description properties as they are now
  used on UNIX platforms as well as Windows.
* Fix a problem where the wrapper would sometimes fail to send a packet to
  the JVM because the sending of the packet would block.  Thanks to Peter
  Gorgon for the patch.
* Fix a problem where CPUs identifying themselves as 'ia64n' or 'ia64w' were
  not correctly being categorized as 'ia'. Thanks to Stirling Chow for the
  patch.  Patch #1859412.
* Add -d and --dump commands to the Windows version which make it possible to
  send thread dump requests to the Wrapper when running as a service.  Works
  in association with the new wrapper.thread_dump_control_code property.
  Feature Request #1118110.
* (Professional) Add wrapper.timer.<n>.interval and wrapper.timer.<n>.action
  properties which make it possible to schedule Wrapper shutdowns, JVM
  restarts and thread dumps at arbitrary times.
* Fix a problem where the default configuration file name was being corrupted
  by a buffer overrun.  Thanks to Rob Joyce for the patch.  Patch #1879049.
* Fix a problem where the WrapperManager would sometimes attempt to unregister
  its shutdown hook after the shutdown hook had been initiated.  Bug #1799489.
* Fix a problem where log files were limited to 2GB on Linux systems.
  Bug #1881038.

3.2.3
* Add support for x86 Mac OS X distributions.
* The 3.2.2 Windows version was accidentally released with its MFC libraries
  dynamically linked.  This meant that anyone who did not have VS8 installed
  were not able to run the Wrapper due to missing DLLs.  This version fixes
  that snafu by correctly using statically linked libraries as was done in
  previous versions built with VS6.  Bug #1578554.

3.2.2
* Correct a typo in the usage output of the WrapperStartStopApp.  Thanks to
  Michael Giroux for pointing it out.
* Fix a problem on OSF1 systems where the backend socket was not listening
  correctly due to a backlog of 0.  This was broken in 3.2.0.  Thanks to
  Phillip Gussow for supplying a patch.
* Remove the com.silveregg.wrapper package classes that were deprecated in
  version 3.0.0.
* Fix a potential problem in the UNIX script where the lock file permissions
  were not being set correctly if the LOCKFILE and RUN_AS_USER variables are
  specified but the group of the specified user could not be resolved.
* Fix a problem where the exit code returned by WrapperListener.stop was being
  ignored in some cases.
* Fix a problem where the shell script would not work correctly when the
  wrapper or its configuration files were located in a directory path
  containing spaces.
* Apply a series of patches by Michael Saya to get the Windows 64 bit build
  working.
* Fix a problem in UNIX versions where the SIGTERM handler was being disabled
  when a SIGCHLD was received.
* Added support in UNIX versions for the SIGHUP signal.
* Migrated the source to Subversion from CVS.  Did a bunch of cleanup in the
  source, removing CVS specific tags.
* Fix a problem in UNIX versions were the pid file specified by the
  wrapper.java.pidfile property contained the wrapper pid rather than the
  jvm pid.  Bug #1565011.
* Fix a problem in UNIX versions where the file specified by the
  wrapper.java.pidfile property was not always being deleted when the JVM
  process went away.
* A user encountered a JVM bug where calls to System.exit were resulting in
  an IllegalThreadStateException being thrown.  Added some code to trap this
  and shut down the JVM using other means to avoid a hang during shutdown.
* Fix a NullPointerException caused by users incorrectly implementing
  an Integration Method #3 class and then calling WrapperManager.start with
  a null value for the args parameter.
* Update the banner displayed by the Wrapper on startup to include a
  copyright notice.  Please see the license page of the documentation for
  details.
* Add a new 'Z' log format which will log the time to millisecond accuracy.
* Fix a problem where the JVM exit code was not being set correctly when
  the JVM was shutdown using WrapperManager.stopImmediate().  The exit code
  of the Wrapper was being set correctly through other means however.
* Fix a potential synchronization problem in the logging code if a JVM exits
  with debug output enabled.
* Updated the WrapperListener.stop method javadocs to better explain the
  exitCode value under certain exit modes.
* On UNIX versions, add a log message which records the signal that caused
  the JVM process to exit when it terminates unexpectedly.
* Fix a problem where the wrapper.on_exit.<n> property was not working
  correctly in some cases on UNIX.  With help from Andreas Schafer.
* Add support for building the Wrapper with Visual Studio 8 for Windows.
  Releases will now be done using this compiler.
* Fix a CRITICAL bug in the 3.2.0 and 3.2.1 Windows versions of the Wrapper
  where the Wrapper would crash under rare circumstances when running as a
  service.  If the service manager interrogated the service at the same
  instant as the wrapper was pinging the JVM, the wrapper was sometimes
  crashing due to a synchronization problem.   The problem did not exist
  prior to 3.2.0.  Bug #1574537.
* Fix a minor logging problem where the 'D' format was not displaying the
  correct thread name for queued log messages.

3.2.1
* Fix a problem with the solaris-sparc-64 makefile.
* Add a solaris-x86-64 makefile.
* Merge in a patch by Hugo Weber to make it possible to configure the Wrapper
  to pull the JRE from the system registry on windows.
* Fix a batch file bug added in 3.2.0 where the scripts would not function
  correctly if the full path to the batch file contained spaces.
  Bug #1450601.
* Modify the message shown when a native library fails to load so the
  exception message text is now shown in the log without having to enable
  debug log output.
* Modify the UNIX shell script to be more informative if the script is unable
  to locate a wrapper binary due to a executable bit permission problem.
* Fix a minor permission problem with the build for the delta-pack.
* Commit a patch by Juergen Hermann to make the error shown when realpath
  fails clearer.
* Add the ability to use a default wrapper.conf file that is in the same
  directory as the wrapper binary.  The file will be named based on the
  name of the wrapper binary.
* Synchronize the command line so that both the Windows and UNIX versions
  are now the same.  The old command line syntaxes are now supported
  everywhere so there will be no compatibility problems.
* It is no longer possible to specify arguments using the '/c' syntax.
  This was undocumented so hopefully it is not being used.  The documented
  '-c' syntax must now be used.  The change was necessary to synchronize
  the command line between UNIX and windows platforms.
* The 32-bit HP-UX 3.2.0 build was generating a libwrapper.so file rather
  than libwrapper.sl.
* Make the WrapperManager.setConsoleTitle, getWrapperPID, and getJavaPID
  methods available through JMX.
* Fix a state engine problem introduced in 3.2.0 which was causing the
  wrapper.on_exit.<n> properties to be ignored in most cases.
* Fix a potential problem that could have caused crashes when debug logging
  was enabled.
* Fix a problem where signals were not being handled correctly on some UNIX
  platforms, including AIX.  This was making it impossible to shutdown the
  wrapper cleanly with the TERM signal.  Bug #1477619.
* Add new default environment variables which can be referenced in a
  configuration file to configure platform specific directories and file
  names.  WRAPPER_OS, WRAPPER_ARCH, and WRAPPER_BITS.
* Add a -v argument to make it possible to request the version from a wrapper
  binary.
* Add support for registering the WrapperManager MBean with the
  PlatformMBeanServer when run on a 1.5+ JVM.  See the JMX section in the
  documentation for details.
* Rework the way timeout properties are handled.  Values of 0 now actually
  disable the timeouts rather than setting them to a large value.  To avoid
  overflow problems when converting to internal timer ticks, timeouts are now
  restricted to a maximum of 20 days, or 1728000 seconds.  Change affects the
  wrapper.cpu.timeout, wrapper.startup.timeout, wrapper.ping.timeout,
  wrapper.shutdown.timeout, and wrapper.jvm_exit.timeout properties.  For
  values less than 20 days, there should be no change in functionality.
* Add support for debuggers.  The Wrapper will now show a warning on startup
  and then again the first time a timeout occurs.  But all timeouts will be
  ignored.  This is to avoid problems with the Wrapper restarting a suspended
  JVM in the middle of a debugging session.  The wrapper enters this mode if
  the wrapper.java.command ends with the string "jdb" or "jdb.exe", or the
  "-Xdebug" parameter is passed to the JVM.
* Add 'athlon' to the list of supported architectures.
* Fix a problem where the environment variables loaded when a service was
  started were always the system environment even if the service was running
  as a specific account.  The environment of a specific account will now be
  loaded on top of the system environment if the USERNAME environment
  variable is set by the system.  Bug #1491138.
* Added new wrapper.ntservice.pausable and wrapper.ntservice.pausable.stop_jvm
  properties to make it possible to pause and resume the Wrapper when installed
  as a Windows service.
* Added new Pause and Resume batch files as well as modified the command batch
  file to support pause and resume.
* Added PAUSE and RESUME commands for use by the wrapper.commandfile property.
* Fix a problem with the wrapper.pidfile, wrapper.java.pidfile,
  wrapper.anchorfile, wrapper.commandfile, wrapper.statusfile,
  wrapper.java.statusfile, wrapper.java.idfile, and wrapper.lockfile
  properties where forward slashes in paths were not being changed to back
  slashes on Windows versions.
* Simplify the code used to load a native library by using the
  System.mapLibraryName method rather than doing the same thing manually.
* Add a new wrapper.syslog.facility property which makes it possible to
  specify the syslog facility on UNIX systems.  Thanks for the patch from
  Bruce Pennypacker.
* Removed the custom thread counting used to keep track of when the wrapped
  Java application has completed.  It is now done in a different way that
  will work on all Java implementations without requiring any special
  consideration of the current JVM.   Deprecated the
  wrapper.monitor_thread_count and wrapper.thread_count_delay properties.
  Bug #1470265.
* The WrapperStartStopApp helper class still requires thread counting if the
  stopWait parameter is set to true.  Previous versions all hardcoded the
  system thread count to 1 which worked for most JVMs.  A new system property,
  org.tanukisoftware.wrapper.WrapperStartStopApp.systemThreadCount, was added
  to make it possible to customize.  It currently defaults to 1.
* Make it possible to extend the WrapperSimpleApp and WrapperStartStopApp
  helper classes.  Feature Request #1510274.
* Add warning messages if the old org.silveregg.wrapper package classes are
  still being used.  They will be removed in the next release.

3.2.0
* Rework the release cycle so that the wrapper.jar file released for all
  platforms is now built on the same machine.  This resolves a few
  incompatibility problems caused by jars built on very new JVMs but run
  on old JVMs.
* Add additional output when the JVM can not be launched due to security
  restrictions on Windows.
* Greatly improved the performance of file logging.  On a windows test machine
  3.1.2 could log 67210 lines of output in 20 seconds with a 80-15% split
  between the Wrapper and JVM process CPU usage.  It now outputs 215214 lines
  with a 64-34% split, also showing less load on the system process.  This is
  a 220% increase in performance.  In both cases, the JVM was completely idle
  other than the console output which makes the Wrapper appear to be a bit of
  a CPU hog.  In fact it is the only process doing any work in this case.
  This improvement was accomplished by keeping the log file open unless idle.
  The idle time can be controlled using the new
  wrapper.logfile.inactivity.timeout property.  The speed increase on UNIX
  platforms was much smaller at around 10%.
* Add a new property, wrapper.disable_restarts, which will completely disable
  the Wrapper's ability to restart JVMs.
* Add a pair of new properties, wrapper.port.min and wrapper.port.max, which
  make it possible to define the port range used when a specific wrapper.port
  is not specified.
* Fix a problem where certain characters like umlauts were being stripped from
  property values.  Bug #1049528.
* Make the PIDs of the Wrapper and Java process easier to access by providing
  a new pair os system properties; wrapper.pid and wrapper.java.pid, as well
  as a new pair of methods; WrapperManager.getWrapperPID() and
  WrapperManager.getJavaPID().
* Add a new WrapperEventListener class which can be implemented to receive
  a wide variety of events from the Wrapper.
* Add a WrapperServiceControlEvent class which will report any service control
  codes received by the Wrapper as it is running as an NT service.   This was
  added to make it possible for other applications to sent custom codes to the
  Wrapper using the Window Service Manager.
* Add a WrapperManager.listServices() method which can be used to obtain the
  status of all services on a Windows system.
* Add a WrapperManager.sendServiceControlCode() method which makes it possible
  to start, stop, pause, continue, any service on Windows systems.  It is also
  possible to send custom user codes via the service manager.
* Add comments in the sh script to support the chkconfig command.
* Implement the ability to read from standard input via System.in.  Feature
  Request #1024693.
* Made the tick based timer the default by changing the default value of the
  wrapper.use_system_time property to false.  Most users should see an
  improvement in reliability under heavy loads with this new setting.  If you
  have extended any timeouts in the past, you may wish to try going back to
  defaults as they may no longer need to be extended.
* Add a new wrapper.restart.reload_configuration property which causes the
  Wrapper to reload its configuration file immediately before a JVM restart.
  Properties which can not be reloaded have comments stating that fact in
  their documentation.  Feature Request #981060.
* Fix a problem in the UNIX shell script which was preventing the script from
  locating the PID and anchor files when the wrapper.working.dir property was
  used.
* Modify UNIX versions so that the wrapper binary will now force its working
  directory to the location of the wrapper binary.   This change was made to
  make the UNIX version work the same way as the Windows version and thus make
  configuration files that modify their working directory work correctly on
  a cross platform basis.  Users which have been using the scripts supplied
  with the Wrapper should not encounter any problems.  Other users may require
  slight changes to their configuration file to deal with the new way that the
  Wrapper deals with its initial working directory.
* Add a new method WrapperManager.getProperties() which makes it possible to
  access any property in the Wrapper configuration file.
* Fix a problem where TERM signals were not being correctly ignored by the
  JVM process on UNIX platforms even if the wrapper.ignore_signals property
  was set to true.   Earlier versions of the Wrapper would generate a
  WRAPPER_CTRL_SHUTDOWN_EVENT when a TERM signal was received.   On Windows
  that signal should never be ignored.  To resolve this a new
  WRAPPER_CTRL_TERM_EVENT was added making it possible to selectively ignore
  the TERM signals.  This change may affect user implementations of the
  WrapperListener.controlEvent() method.  Bug #1086344.
* The Windows version has a feature which allows the user to immediately kill
  the Wrapper and its Java application without waiting for a clean shutdown
  by pressing CTRL-C twice.  Windows sends the CTRL-C signal to both the
  Wrapper and Java processes.  Due to a rare timing problem, it was possible
  for the Java process to get the signal first and initialize a shutdown
  before the Wrapper could respond to the signal.  In this case the Wrapper
  was interpreting this as a second CTRL-C signal even though the user only
  pressed it once.
* If the wrapper.anchorfile or wrapper.pidfile properties are used on Windows
  they were being unintentionally deleted if the -t, -p, -i, or -r commands
  were used while another Wrapper instance was running.  In the case of the
  anchor file, this would result in the Wrapper being shutdown unintentionally.
  This was not an issue on non-Windows versions.  Bug #1108517.
* Fix a security problem where the value of the wrapper.ntservice.account
  and wrapper.ntservice.password properties were being stored in plain text
  within the registry if they were specified on the command line when
  installing the Wrapper as a Windows service.  Bug #1110183.
* Add a pair of properties wrapper.ntservice.password.prompt and
  wrapper.ntservice.password.prompt.mask which which will cause the Wrapper
  to prompt the user for an account password when it is being installed as
  an NT service.
* Added system properties to make it possible to configure whether or not
  the WrapperSimpleApp and WrapperStartStopApp helper classes will wait
  for the configured main methods to complete before reporting that the
  application has started.  See the javadocs for these classes for more
  details.
* Modify the HP-UX build so that it now dynamically links with the pthread
  library.  This was to make the binaries work with HP-UX 11.00.  Thanks to
  Sun Kun Choi for the patch.
* Add new wrapper.statusfile and wrapper.java.statusfile properties which can
  be used by external applications to monitor the internal state of the Wrapper
  or JVM at any given time.  These will not be useful to most users.
* Add a new wrapper.commandfile property which can be used by external
  applications to control the Wrapper and its JVM.
* Add a new wrapper.java.idfile property which can be used by external
  applications to monitor the internal state of the JVM at any given time.
* Add a warning on startup if the JVM has a SecurityManager set but the
  wrapper.jar has not been granted the AllPermissions permission.  Failure
  to do so will almost certainly lead to the Wrapper throwing a number of
  errors and this helps to point out the cause.
* Add a security model which protects most Wrapper method calls when a
  SecurityManager has been registered.  See the Security Model section
  for more details.
* Add a new pair of batch files which can be used to start and stop the
  Wrapper when installed as a service.
* Add new -q and -qs commands to the Windows version of the Wrapper which
  make it possible to query the currently installed status of the service.
* Fix a problem where the wrapper.java.library.path.append_system_path
  property was not working correctly on Windows when the system PATH
  contained quotes.  Bug #1238726.
* Modify the usage output of the Wrapper on all platforms so the Wrapper's
  version is now included.  It was not previously possible to get the version
  of the Wrapper being used without launching a JVM.
* Add a pair of new methods WrapperManager.stopAndReturn() and
  WrapperManager.restartAndReturn() which make it possible for code to
  stop or restart the JVM and then continue until the JVM is shutdown.
  This can be useful for shutdowns initiated within places like servlets,
  whose operation is expected to complete.
* Fix a problem on UNIX where the child JVM was sometimes leaving around
  zombie processes after a restart.  The SIGCHLD signal was not being handled
  correctly.  Thanks to Traun Leyden for the patch.  Bug #1291201.
* Implement the ability to catch control events using the WrapperEventLisener.
  Feature Request #836975.
* Add new wrapper.jvm.port, wrapper.jvm.port.min, and wrapper.jvm.port.max
  properties which make it possible to control the port the JVM uses to open
  a connection back to the JVM.  The Wrapper uses to leave this up to the
  OS, but some users were having problems with the default conflicting with
  other ports.
* Switch from using ftime() to gettimeofday() on UNIX platforms to work around
  a problem where the Wrapper would not run on new versions of OSX because
  they deprecated the ftime() function call.  Thanks for the patch by
  Michael Macaluso.  Bug #1313162.
* Remove the shutdown timeout from the UNIX shell script.  It is not needed
  and can cause a zombie JVM if the wrapper's internal shutdown timeout was
  longer than that of the shell script.
* Add the ability to specify integer property values in base 8 or 16 in
  addition to base 10.  Base 8 values start with a '0' and base 16 values
  start with a '0x'.
* Make it possible to set the umask on all files created by the Wrapper
  as well as the default umask of files created by the JVM.  Added new
  wrapper.umask, wrapper.java.umask, wrapper.pidfile.umask,
  wrapper.lockfile.umask, wrapper.java.pidfile.umask,
  wrapper.java.idfile.umask, wrapper.statusfile.umask,
  wrapper.java.statusfile.umask, wrapper.anchorfile.umask, and
  wrapper.logfile.umask properties.
* Improve the message when the native library can not be loaded to make mention
  of the possibility of a 32/64 bit mismatch.
* Add a new wrapper.monitor_thread_count property which makes it possible to
  disable the Wrapper's counting of non-daemon threads and thus the shutting
  down of the JVM when they have all completed.
* Add support for BELOW_NORMAL and ABOVE_NORMAL options to the
  wrapper.ntservice.process_priority property.  Feature Request #1373922.
* Ignore '#' characters which are included within double quotes in the value
  of a property in the configuration file.  Unquoted values must be escaped
  with a second '#' characters or it will be interpreted as a comment.
* Display the Wrapper banner in the JVM earlier so that it is displayed
  even where there are startup errors.
* Modify the WrapperSimpleApp and WrapperStartStopApp classes so that the
  WrapperManager is always initialized immediately.  This makes the output
  clearer in the event of startup errors.
* Fix a problem where the Windows ServiceManager was not correctly reporting
  a startup error if a service failed on startup.  The service was being
  reported as having started even though it failed to start.
* Fix a problem on UNIX versions where the Wrapper would go into a recursive
  state of attempting to launch the JVM from failed child processes if there
  was any problems executing the configured java process.
* Rework the way the RUN_AS_USER setting in the UNIX shell script works so
  the specified user is now set regardless of the command being executed.
  To make sure the user never has to enter the password twice when running
  the script, it now recurses after changing the user.  The script then
  runs entirely as the configured user.
* Improve the message that is displayed when attempting to start, stop, or
  remove a windows service which is not installed.
* Add new wrapper.lockfile property which makes it possible to specify a
  lock file containing a pid.
* Modified the sh script so it now creates a lock file on startup in the
  /var/lock/subsys directory if it exists.  This is needed by fedora systems
  on shutdown.
* Store javadocs in tar distibutions in a nested tar file to avoid problems
  with long filenames in some tar distributions.
* Fix a problem with the WrapperSimpleApp and WrapperStartStopApp helper
  classes where on heavily loaded systems it was possible for the Wrapper
  to get a running thread count of 0 and shutdown before the main thread
  had a chance to be started.
* Add a new wrapper.thread_count_delay property which will force the
  WrapperManager to wait the specified number of seconds before it begins
  to check the number of running threads.
* Fix a problem where the wrapper.java.library.path.append_system_path
  property was appending the PATH rather than the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment
  variable on Unix systems.  PATH is correct for Windows systems.
* Add a new wrapper.logfile.rollmode property which makes it possible to
  control how and when the logfile is rolled.  Feature Requests #864463,
  #1085097, and #1085850.
* Fix a problem on Linux where the test for the status of the Java child
  process would sometimes fail causing the Wrapper to shutdown with the
  error "Critical error: wait for JVM process failed (No child processes)"
  rather than restart the child JVM.  Users who encountered this problem
  found it easy to reproduce, but it only happened on some systems.
* Modify the way the UNIX shell script tests for the existence of a process
  matching the pid in an existing pid file.  It now verifies the process
  command as well as the pid to fix a system reboot problem where a stale
  pid has been reused by another application, making the script think the
  wrapper was already running.
* Add support for the GNU libjcj JVM.  Like JRocket, it requires slightly
  different thread counting.
* Add support for Linux 64-bit PPC and Solaris 32-bit x86 versions.
* Add a new set.default.ENV syntax to the configuration file making it
  possible to environment variable values which do not overwrite existing
  values, ie. to specify a default value.
* Added a new wrapper.console.flush property which forces the wrapper to
  explicitly flush stdout after each line of log output.
* Change the error shown when the JVM shuts down prematurely during a
  shutdown to a warning message.
* Fix a problem where the Wrapper would show the following error message
  if user code called System.exit from within the WrapperListener.stop
  callback method.  This would happen if the stop class's main method
  registered with the WrapperStartStopApp called System.exit.
  "JVM exited unexpectedly while stopping the application."
  Bug #945976.
* Add a new wrapper.syslog.ident property which makes it possible to
  specify the identity used in syslog entries on UNIX.  This was possible
  in older versions but was set using the wrapper.ntservice.name property.
  Bug #1432855.
* Add support for MacOSX Universal Binary distributions.
* Add support for Delta Pack distributions.  This is a distribution that
  contains the binaries of multiple platforms.

3.1.2
* Modify the way boolean system properties are resolved by the WrapperManager
  so it is now possible to set them to true or false rather than assuming they
  are true if set.
* Fix a problem where some localized error messages were not having their
  tokens replaced correctly.
* Fix a problem when using the WrapperStartStopApp helper class.  The usage
  text was incorrectly being displayed in the console if an exception was
  thrown while executing the main method of the configured stop class.  This
  did not change the functionality of the application, but it did cause some
  confusion.
* Fix a problem on Windows where a library path or class path which ended in
  a backslash was preventing the Wrapper from launching the JVM.  The Windows
  OS was using the backslash to escape the quote used to close the path.  The
  fix was to add a second backslash where needed.
* Added a new wrapper.java.command.loglevel property which makes it possible
  to control the log level of the generated java command.
* Add support for escaped quotes when stripping quotes on UNIX for the
  wrapper.java.additional.<n> and wrapper.app.parameter.<n> properties.
* Change the default value of wrapper.jvm_exit.timeout from 5 to 15 seconds.
  The old default was too fast for some applications which take a while to
  exit.  Applications which were exiting promptly will not see any difference.
* Fix a problem where the JVM would restart at certain times when using the
  system time based timer due to an overflow error.  This problem was
  introduced in 3.1.0.  Due to a separate bug in 3.1.0, the Wrapper would
  shutdown rather than simply restarting the JVM as was happening in 3.1.1.
  The last restart happened on Aug 21, 2004.  It will next occur Oct 10, 2004
  and repeat at regular intervals.  There are no problems when using the new
  Tick based timer.  Bug #1014405.
* Correct the wrapper.logfile.maxsize property so that a a kilobyte is now 1024
  rather than 1000, and a megabyte is a megabyte.  We aren't a hard drive
  manufacturer after all.
* Add try-catch blocks around all thread entry points in the Windows version.
  This has always been done in the main function, but these blocks will help
  to narrow down the cause of problems should they ever be encountered in
  control or service handlers.
* Centralize shutdown code on UNIX version in an appExit method as was already
  being done for Windows versions.
* Fix a problem where the build.sh was not correctly using the included ant
  if an ANT_HOME environment variable was defined.
* Add a new wrapper.single_invocation property which will prevent multiple
  invocations of an application from being started on Windows platforms.
  The shell script handles this on UNIX platforms.  Feature Request #889123.
* Fix a crash problem introduced in 3.1.1, caused by a pair of uninitialized
  pointers.  The crash was possible on all platforms but would only happen
  if the Wrapper was started without any arguments.  It would not affect
  users running the Wrapper normally.  Bug #1018481.
* Fix a problem with the run as user feature of the shell script on Solaris.
  Needed to be using /usr/xpg4/bin/id rather than /usr/bin/in if available.
  Bug #1024008.
* Replace calls to usleep with nanosleep on platforms where it is available.
  This was to fix an occasional hang on a specific Solaris machine.  It would
  occasionally hang on calls to usleep.  From research, it appears that usleep
  has problems when signals are encountered while sleeping.  Still testing
  whether or not this change solved the problem.
* Upgrade the version of Ant included with source releases to 1.6.2 to fix
  some problems generating jni headers when building with Java 1.4.2.
* Upgrade the version of Cocoon included with source releases to 2.0.4 to
  fix some problems generating documentation using Java 1.4.2.
* Display a warning if the exit status of a JVM process ever returns the
  STILL_ACTIVE status on Windows.  There was no known problem here, just
  noticed it while looking over the code.
* Display a descriptive error message on Windows if the JVM process crashes
  due to an uncaught exception in native JVM code.
* Add a test for invalid jvm arguments set using the wrapper.java.additional.<n>
  properties.  Invalid arguments could cause the Wrapper startup to fail in
  non obvious ways if they are mistaken by the JVM as the main class.

3.1.1
* Modified the way libwrapper.so is built on Solaris and Linux so that it
  no longer statically links its required libraries.
* Fix a file handle leak when calling WrapperManager.getUser or
  WrapperManager.getInteractiveUser on Windows platforms.
* Fix a problem introduced in 3.1.0 where the JVM would not be restarted
  correctly if it quit after a ping timeout to let the Wrapper resynch and
  restart it.
* Fix a problem where CTRL-C was not being handled correctly if the console
  was configured to be shown when running as an NT service.
* Fix a problem where signals fired at UNIX versions of the wrapper were
  not being handled correctly when the tick timer was being used.
* Fix a synchronization problem in the logging code which would
  occassionally cause the Wrapper to crash with an Access Violation.
  The problem was only encountered when the tick timer was enabled,
  and was only seen on multi-CPU systems.  Bug #949877.
* Fix a problem when using the tick timer where the Wrapper would sometimes
  exit on startup due to an uncaught SIGALRM.  Only reported on multi-CPU
  Solaris systems.
* Fix a problem where the Wrapper would sometimes hang on shutdown if
  another thread called System.exit while the Wrapper was shutting down.
  Bug #955248.
* Fix a problem introduced in 3.1.0 where a very very large CPU timeout
  warning message was being displayed if the system time was set back
  while using the default system timer.
* Added a new property, wrapper.anchorfile, which makes it possible to
  cause the Wrapper to shutdown by deleting an anchor file.  The UNIX sh
  script has been modified to optionally make use of this feature.
* Add a debug message at startup which makes it clear which timer is being
  used.
* A Windows user reported that using forward slashes in the path the log
  file was failing.  Avoid this problem by always converting '/' to '\'
  in the wrapper.logfile property on Windows.
* Fix a problem where it was not possible disable the wrapper log file as
  documented in the wrapper.logfile property.  Most likely broken way back
  in version 2.2.5.
* Add some additional error checks after calls to control the pipe between
  the JVM and Wrapper as well as improving the messages around other socket
  related error messages.
* Fix a problem on some HP-UX systems were not working correctly because
  the EAGAIN and EWOULDBLOCK constants are not equal with some compilers.
* Change some of the defaults in the src/conf/wrapper.conf.in file which
  ships with the Wrapper to avoid confusion with new users.
* Rewrote the routine which reads and logs console output from the JVM
  for Windows versions.  Internal buffers are now scaled dynamically,
  fixing a problem where long lines were being wrapped at 1024 characters.
  This rewrite also resulted in a 4 fold increase in speed when the JVM is
  sending large quantities of output to the console.
* Increase debug output on UNIX platforms when a signal is caught.  When
  possible, information about where the signal came from is now logged.
* Modified the way log output from within signal handlers is handled so it
  is now queued and then logged by the main event loop.
* Back out a 3.1.0 change where a JVM that had failed to exit cleanly was
  sent a SIGTERM prior to a SIGKILL.  The SIGTERM made no difference and
  slowed down the forced shutdown.  A modification to the event loop made
  the functionality more difficult to implement.
* Add the ability to set the user that the Wrapper and its JVM will run as
  from within the sh script on UNIX platforms.
* Add an icon resource to the Wrapper binary on Windows versions.
* Fix a typo in the UNIX sh script which caused an extra slash to be included
  in the path of the pid file.  Was not causing any known problems.
* Added support for 64-bit HP-UX.  Big thanks to Venkatesh Sellappa for
  supplying the patch.
* Fix a deadlock problem introduced in 3.1.0 with some FreeBSD systems.  Not
  all users were experiencing it, but those who did were able to reliably
  reproduce the problem.  The problem appears to have been caused by
  FreeBSD bug #kern/64313.
* Make the signal handling variables in the wrapper native library volatile.
  Directly this was to fix a compiler warning on HP-UX64 systems but it
  should also make the calls more efficient.

3.1.0
* The license was revised for this version to include a copyright omission.
  This change is to be retroactively applied to all versions of the Java
  Service Wrapper starting with version 3.0.0.  The changes should have
  no effect on users.
* The Online documentation and web site were both reworked.  The logo has
  been updated so that Duke is no longer used.  The new online site now
  has the ability for users to logon and append comments to any page.
* Added a new batch file which accepts commands like the UNIX shell script.
  The new file is offered as an alternative to the default batch files, and
  can be found at src/bin/AppCommand.bat.in.  Thanks to Mike Castle for
  donating the new script.
* The Windows version of the Wrapper was not correctly registering that it
  would accept SHUTDOWN messages when running as a service.  The Wrapper
  was getting the message anyway so this should not change functionality.
  Thanks to Jason Tishler for noticing this and sending in a patch.
* Add a new property, wrapper.native_library, which can be used to specify
  the base name of the native library which is loaded by the WrapperManager
  class.
* Modify the WrapperManager class so it now stores references to System.out
  and System.err on initialization and always writes to those stored streams.
  This makes sure that all Wrapper console output always goes to the
  wrapper.log file even if user code overrides those streams with calls to
  System.setOut and System.setErr.  This was necessary to prevent deadlocks
  in such user code from affecting the functionality of the Wrapper.
* Fixed a problem where some environment variables where not being correctly
  loaded from the system registry when running as an NT service.  Big thanks
  to Eric Smith for tracking this down and submitting a patch.  It turns out
  that the putenv function was not being used correctly.
* Modified the way the wrapper.conf file is loaded so it will now read the
  contents correctly even if the line feeds in the file are incorrect for
  the current platform.  Windows line feeds had been causing problems when
  used on UNIX platforms.  Feature Request #829896.
* Added a new property, wrapper.ntservice.console, which allows a console to
  be displayed when running as an NT service.
* Fixed a problem where the request thread dump on failed JVM exit feature
  had never worked when running as an NT service.  Bug #831775.
* Add a new property, wrapper.console.title, which makes it possible to set
  the title of the console in which the Wrapper is currently running.  This
  currently only works on Windows platforms.
* Added a new method, setConsoleTitle, to the WrapperManager class which
  enables the application to dynamically set the console title.  Like the
  wrapper.console.title property, this only works on Windows platforms.
* Improved the algorithm of the request thread dump on failed JVM exit feature
  so that extremely large thread dumps will not be truncated when the JVM
  is killed.
* Fix a problem where CTRL-C was being ignored by the WrapperManager if a
  WrapperListener is never registered.  This is not possible if the Wrapper
  is being used correctly but never the less a user did come across it.
* Add some additional debug output to help identify the cause of problems
  loading the native library.
* The WrapperManager class now checks to make sure that its current version
  matches the version of the native library and Wrapper.  If there are any
  discrepancies found then appropriate warnings will be displayed, but the
  Application will still be allowed to start.  This was added to make obvious
  the cause of problems resulting from mismatched versions.
* Added a new property wrapper.use_system_time system time.  By setting this
  property to false, the Wrapper will start using a new experimental timer
  which uses a background thread to manage time rather than the system time.
  This has a number of advantages over using the system time and should give
  most users even more reliable behavior when the system is under high load
  or there are changes being made to the system time.  The timer is very
  critical to the operation of the Wrapper so the old behavior is left as
  the default for the time being until this feature has had the chance to be
  "time" tested.  If all goes well then this will be enabled as the default
  in a future version of the Wrapper.
  A pair of related properties, wrapper.timer_fast_threshold and
  wrapper.timer_slow_threshold were also added to aid in debugging.
* Rework the logging code so it is now thread safe.  The addition of the
  timer thread means that there is now more than a single thread accessing
  that code.  This was causing problems as the two threads tried to use the
  same buffers.  As part of this change, a new format variable 'D' was added
  to display the thread which is doing the logging.
* Fix a problem where a thread dump would be invoked if the request thread
  dump on failed JVM exit was enabled and the user forced an immediate
  shutdown by pressing CTRL-C more than once.
* Add getUser and getInteractiveUser methods to the WrapperManager class to
  make it possible for user code to query information about the user running
  Wrapper or the user who is interacting with the Wrapper and its JVM.
  Feature Request #812175.
* The Wrapper will now always exit with the exit code used to terminate the JVM
  whether System.exit is used or WrapperManager.stop.  When running as an NT
  service the Wrapper now correctly returns the correct exit code to the
  service manager so failure recovery tools should now work correctly.
  Feature Request #852491.
* Add a status command to the UNIX shell script which can be used to find out
  whether or not the wrapper is currently running.  Patch submitted by
  Joseph Benavidez.
* Modify the WrapperSimpleApp and WrapperStartStopApp so that the main method
  of a class is located even if it exists in a parent class rather than the
  class specified.
* To make debugging classpath problems easier, the Wrapper now verifies all
  classpath entries before launching a JVM and logs debug level warnings for
  any entries that do not exist.
* Fix a problem where it was possible to define a zero length filter that would
  trigger on any output.
* Add some additional debug output to make it easier to debug startup,
  shutdown and restart problems.
* Modify the way the Wrapper forcibly kills a frozen JVM on UNIX platforms so
  that it now sends a SIGTERM, waits up to 5 seconds, then sends a SIGKILL.
* Add a new wrapper.java.library.path.append_system_path property which will
  cause the Wrapper to append the system path to the generated library path.
  Feature Request #917902.
* Fix a problem where spaces around the '=' character of a property definition
  were rendering the property invisible to the Wrapper.  Bug #916001.
* Fix a problem where the first ping timeout after the JVM was started was
  still hard coded at 30 seconds.  This was causing a combination of large
  values of wrapper.ping.interval and wrapper.ping.timeout to fail.
* Fix a problem where the JVM would fail to shutdown cleanly if the Wrapper
  was asked to stop too soon after launching a JVM.  This was leading to the
  JVM being killed after the shutdown timeout expired.  Bug #917281.
* Added an adviser which will print out explanatory messages to the console
  and wrapper log file when the Wrapper encounters a commonly made
  configuration mistake.  This is designed to cut down on support requests
  by new users.  Can be disabled using the wrapper.adviser property.
* The bash script and the realpath utility have been deprecated since version
  3.0.3.  They have been removed in this release.  The sh script is recommended
  on all UNIX platforms, and the realpath utility which was used by pre-3.0.3
  bash and sh scripts has not been used since.
* Add the wrapper.startup.delay property along with console and service
  specific variants which make it possible to configure a delay between the
  Wrapper being launched and the first JVM being launched.
* Promote the wrapper.debug property back from being "deprecated".  It has
  continued to be useful and deserved documentation and official status.
* Add wrapper.on_exit.<n> properties to control what happens when a exits
  based on the exit code.
* Modify the way calls to System.in.read() are handled so that they now block
  rather than throwing an exception.  Currently, System.in can not be used with
  the Wrapper because of the way I/O is passed between the Wrapper and JVM.
* Modified the Windows batch files to fix a problem where the path to the
  Wrapper.exe contained more than one "/bin".  The new batch files are much
  simpler and should be easier to customize if needed.  Bug #925308.
* Modified the wrapper.java.initmemory and wrapper.java.maxmemory properties
  so that they now default to a value of 0 which causes the -Xms and -Xmx
  parameters to be omitted from the command used to launch Java.  This
  will cause the JVM to use its own default values and also makes it possible
  to specify the memory parameters using the wrapper.java.additional.<n>
  properties.
* Added a pair of environment variables, WRAPPER_FILE_SEPARATOR and
  WRAPPER_PATH_SEPARATOR, whose values are set to either '/' and ':' or
  '\' and ';' on startup.  They can be used in the wrapper.conf file
  to construct platform independent property values.
* Add a new wrapper.working.dir property which makes if possible to change
  the Wrapper and JVM's working directory to a location other than the
  location of the Wrapper binary. Feature Request #738160.

3.0.5
* Added support for SGI Irix.  Big thanks to Andreas Wendt for supplying the
  patch.
* Due to a bug in the build, the native library was not included in the 3.0.3
  or 3.0.4 binary releases for OSX, building from source was working correctly.
  This has been fixed and the build greatly simplified to avoid such problems
  in the future. Bug #791755.
* Changed the default location of the pid file generated by the sh script to
  exist in the same directory as the sh script rather than in the /var/run.
  This can be changed by setting the PIDDIR variable in the sh script used to
  launch the Wrapper.
* Added support for the wrapper.pidfile property on the Windows platform.
* Added the wrapper.java.pidfile property which will cause the pid of the
  java process to be written to a specified file.
  (WINDOWS USERS) If you are using a wrapper.conf file that was created prior
  to version 3.0.0 of the Wrapper, then you may have this property defined in
  your configuration file.  You will get an error on startup if the specified
  path does not exist.
* Stop clearing the file creation mask when the Unix version of the Wrapper is
  run as a daemon process.  The file creation mask will not be inherited from
  the process which launches the Wrapper.  Bug #788849.
* Modify the sh script so it works on Linux, then deprecate the bash script.
  This means that all Unix platforms can now use the same script to control
  the Wrapper. Thanks to Mike Castle for the patch.  The bash script can still
  be found in the release, but it is deprecated and will be removed in a
  future version.
* Modified the sh script so it is now possible to set the nice priority in the
  script configuration block.
* Remove output to System.out in the WrapperManager.requestThreadDump() method.
  If some JVM threads were hung while accessing the System.out object,
  attempting to do a thread a dump would cause the calling thread to hang as
  well.  Thanks to Thomas Hart for the patch.
* Make it obvious in the log whether or not the Wrapper was started as a
  daemon process on UNIX systems.
* Modify the way restarts requested from the JVM, or caused by a filter are
  handled.  The Wrapper will no longer reset the restart count in either of
  these cases.  If an application runs for longer than the
  wrapper.successful_invocation_time timeout then the count will still be
  reset back to 0.
* Added a new wrapper.ignore_signals property which makes it possible to
  configure the Wrapper so it will ignore CTRL-C, HALT and INT signals.
* Modify the WrapperManager.isLaunchedAsService() method on UNIX systems so it
  now returns true if the Wrapper was launched with the wrapper.daemonize flag
  set.
* Added a pair of MBean interfaces which allow the Wrapper to be controlled
  using JMX.  See the new JMX section in the documentation for details.
  Thanks to Sal Ingrilli for help with testing.
* Modify the Windows build so the Wrapper.exe and Wrapper.dll files can now
  be built from Ant if MSVC is installed.
* Added a new wrapper.ping.interval property which lets users control the
  frequency that the Wrapper pings the JVM.  Feature Request #607768.
* When a JVM refuses to shutdown, the Wrapper can be configured to request a
  thread dump using the wrapper.request_thread_dump_on_failed_jvm_exit
  property.  The Wrapper was then waiting 1 second before the process was
  killed.  This was not always long enough, resulting in a truncated thread
  dump.  Increased the pause to 3 seconds.  Feature Request #633761.
* Fix a bug where wrapper.app.parameter.<n> and wrapper.java.additional.<n>
  properties declared from the Windows command line were not correctly
  handling spaces in their values.  Support Request #802139.

3.0.4
* Fix a problem on UNIX systems where requesting a second thread dump any time
  during the life of a single Wrapper process would cause the Wrapper and JVM
  to shutdown rather than perform the thread dump.
* Fix a problem where a, user without permission, attempting to stop an
  application was able to delete the pid file even though they were unable
  to stop the application itself.  This would make the scripts think that
  the application was stopped when was actually still running.
* Fix a problem where an application was being killed prematurely if it took
  longer than 6 seconds to exit on its own.  The scripts now make sure that
  an application always has enough time to shutdown cleanly.
* Improve the debug output so that packet codes are now shown using a name
  rather than a raw number.
* Reduce the frequency of "Waiting to stop..." messages displayed when removing
  an NT service that is currently running.  Decreased frequency from once per
  second to once every five seconds.
* Fix a minor problem where the hour in the date returned by
  WrapperInfo.getBuildTime() was not base 24.
* Added -t and -p command line options to the Windows version of the Wrapper
  to sTart and stoP the Wrapper as an NT service.  This can be used in place
  of "net start" and "net stop", which do not always work correctly when a
  service takes a long time to start up or shutdown.  See the Launching Your
  Application (Win32) section for more details.
* Add a new method WrapperManager.stopImmediate which will cause the JVM to
  exit immediately without calling any stop methods or shutdown hooks.
* Add a new class, WrapperActionServer, which makes it easy to remotely control
  the Wrapper remotely by opening a socket and sending commands.  See the
  javadocs of the class for more details.
* Fix bug #744801.  A Java GUI was not being displayed when the application was
  run in either console mode or as a service with wrapper.ntservice.interactive
  enabled.  This problem was introduced in Version 3.0.0 when using 1.2.x or
  1.3.x versions of Java.  To use interactive services with 1.2.x or 1.3.x
  versions of java, please review the documentation for the
  wrapper.ntservice.interactive property.
* Fix a problem where the JVM was not receiving CTRL-C and CTRL-CLOSE events
  when running under the Wrapper on Windows.  This was not a problem in most
  cases as the Wrapper was taking care of the processing of the events.  But
  the WrapperListener.controlEvent() method was not being called as documented.
* Changed the way the WrapperSimpleApp and WrapperStartStopApp respond to
  control events so that the JVM will respond and call WrapperManager.stop()
  even when being controlled by the Wrapper.
* Modified the suggested behavior of the WrapperListener.controlEvent() method.
  Users who have implemented the WrapperListener interface themselves should
  review the Javadocs.  The changes are not required and applications will
  continue to function as they did before.
* Added support for DEC OSF1 (Alpha).  Big thanks to Andreas Wendt for
  supplying the patch.
* Fix a problem where the sh and bash scripts were failing if the path to the
  script contained spaces.
* Fix a problem where the JVM would sometimes hang when trying to shutdown if
  the wrapper.key parameter was passed to the JVM while not being controlled
  by the Wrapper.  This would happen if a user copied the command from the
  Wrapper's debug output and attempted to run it as is without first removing
  the wrapper.key parameter.
* Implement the ability to specify an NT service's load order group in response
  to feature request #764143.  See the javadocs for the new
  wrapper.ntservice.load_order_group property for details.
* Improve the error message displayed when the NT EventLog is full in response
  to feature request #643617.  The EventLog output will now be disabled if any
  errors are encountered while logging events.  This prevents the error from
  repeating.
* Improve the error message displayed on Windows when the configured Java
  command can not be executed or does not exist.
* Fix a problem where the Wrapper was leaving a pipe unclosed each time the JVM
  was restarted on all UNIX platforms.  This was causing the Wrapper to run out
  of file handles.   Bug #767267, discovered and patched by David Wong.
* Fix a problem where the '#' character, which signifies a comment, could not
  be included in property values.  A double hash, '##' will now resolve into a
  '#' within the property value.  Bug #777303.
* Added support for FreeBSD.  Big thanks to Alphonse Bendt for supplying the
  patch.
* Make the wrapper.port property optional.
* Changed the way environment variables are loaded from the registry on Windows
  platforms so users will no longer get warning messages about not being able
  to handle very large environment variables.  Prior versions could only handle
  environment variables whose expanded value was less than 2048 characters in
  length.
* Fix a problem on UNIX platforms where a shell used to start the Wrapper
  running as a detached process would hang when the user attempted to exit
  the shell.  Thanks to Mike Castle for this patch.

3.0.3
* Added support for Mac OS X.  Big thanks to Andy Barnett for supplying the
  patch.
* Fix a segmentation fault on UNIX systems when the first console output
  from the JVM was an empty line.  Thanks to Mike Castle for finding this.
* Fix a problem where a 0 length malloc was being called if there were no
  configured filters.  This was fine on most platforms but caused a crash
  on MAC OS X.
* Rework the initialization of the bash and sh scripts so that they will
  work correctly when referenced as symbolic links.  Thanks go out to Richard
  Emberson for the code to resolve symbolic links.
* Deprecated the realpath binary in the *NIX distributions as it is no longer
  used by the bash or sh scripts.  It is being left in for now so as not to
  break the build scripts of other projects, but it will be removed after a
  couple more releases.
* Added a test to make sure that wrapper.ntservice.interactive is not set to
  TRUE when an account is specified using wrapper.ntservice.account.

3.0.2
* Modified the sh and bash scripts so that console log output is disabled by
  default when the scripts are launched with the 'start' action.  Running with
  the 'console' action will still send output to the console.  Logging to the
  file is still enabled.
* Modified the wrapper.ping.timeout property so it also controls the ping
  timeout within the JVM.  Before the timeout on responses to the Wrapper
  could be controlled, but the ping timeout within the JVM was hardcoded to
  30 seconds.
* In the last release, some work was done to avoid false timeouts caused by
  large quantities of output.  On some heavily loaded systems, timeouts were
  still being encountered.  Rather than reading up to 50 lines of input, the
  code will now read for a maximum of 250ms before returning to give the main
  event loop more cycles.
* Fix a problem where the values of environment variables set in the
  configuration file were not correct when those values included references
  to other environment variables.
* Fix a potential buffer overflow problem if configuration properties
  referenced extremely large environment variables.
* Fix a potential problem where the inability to expand very large environment
  variables would have led to an access violation when run as an NT service.
* Add some extra checks in the event where the native library can not be loaded
  so that the WrapperManager can differentiate between the library missing and
  not being readable due to permission problems.
* Remove the wrapper.ntservice.process_priority from the default wrapper.conf
  because its use can produce unexpected results if used improperly.  Please
  see the property documentation for details.
* Fix a problem where environment variables in the registry which had no value
  were causing the Wrapper to crash with an access violation.  This was
  introduced in version 3.0.0 with the feature to load environment variables
  from the registry.  The offending registry entry was WV_GATEWAY_CFG which
  appears to be related to Oracle.

3.0.1
* Fix a problem with the wrapper.disable_shutdown_hook.  Due to a typo in the
  source, the property was being ignored.  This was broken in the 3.0.0
  release.
* Fix a problem with the HP-UX release build reported by Ashish Gawarikar.
* Add the ability to set environment variables from within the configuration
  file or from the command line.
* Fix a problem on HP-UX and AIX machines where the stop() function in the
  shell scripts was causing a syntax error due to a conflict with a like named
  shell command on those platforms.  This appears to be an issue with the
  Korn shell on all platforms.
* Fix a problem where very heavy output from the JVM can cause the Wrapper to
  give a false timeout.  The Wrapper now only reads 50 lines of input at a time
  to guarantee that the Wrapper's event loop always gets cycles.
* Fix a problem on UNIX versions where extra line breaks would sometimes be
  added to the logged output when there was large amounts of output being
  sent from the JVM.
* Fix a problem where a large number of calls to WrapperManager.log()
  immediately before the JVM exits could lead to the Wrapper incorrectly
  reporting that the JVM exited unexpectedly.

3.0.0
* Deprecated the com.silveregg.wrapper package in favor of
  org.tanukisoftware.wrapper.  The classes and interfaces in the silveregg
  package will continue to function, but migration to the new package should
  be done when possible. See the project history for details.
* On Windows systems change any forward slashes in the wrapper.java.command
  property to back slashes.  Some users had reported having problems on
  Windows XP.
* Implemented feature request #633178.  Added WrapperManager.requestThreadDump()
  to force the current JVM to immediately perform a thread dump.
* Fixed bug where wrapper.logfile.maxsize was being set to 0 if the 'k' or 'm'
  unit was omitted.
* Add the ability to specify an account name and password when installing an
  NT service.
* Add a property, wrapper.ntservice.interactive, which makes it possible to
  control whether or not the Java process can gain access to the desktop while
  it is running as an NT service.
* Add limited support for 1.2.x versions of Java.  Shutdown hooks are
  supported until Java 1.3 so those functions will be disabled.  If the
  application displays a GUI then Java 1.3 should be used as the GUI can not
  currently be displayed when using Java 1.2.x.
* Made it possible to use the wrapper.pidfile property on all *nix platforms.
  Please notice that the property has been removed from the default
  wrapper.conf file.  The property is not needed when the wrapper is launched
  with the bash shell script.  The sh shell script will set the wrapper.pidfile
  when the wrapper is launched.  If either of the scripts provided with the
  Wrapper distribution are used then the wrapper.pidfile should always be
  removed from your wrapper.conf file.
* Added a new wrapper.daemonize property which, when set, will form the wrapper
  process to be a detached non-session group leader.  This makes it possible to
  launch the wrapper in such a way that it will not be terminated when the user
  launching the process logs out.  This had been a problem on Solaris systems
  when using the sh shell.  The default sh and bash scripts both make use of
  this in the default.  Please update your scripts for use with this version.
  Thanks to Rajiv Subrahmanyam for the patch.
* Fix a problem where the Wrapper was incorrectly counting the number of
  non-daemon threads in BEA's JRockit Virtual Machine.  This was causing the
  application to shutdown when the non-daemon thread count dropped to 1.
* Added support for building the wrapper on AIX and HP-UX systems.  Thanks for
  the patches involved go out to Ashish Gawarikar and William Lee.
* Implement feature request #653131 to force the JVM to immediately exit when
  the user presses CTRL-C multiple times.
* Added a 'console' action to the bash and sh scripts to make it possible to
  launch the Wrapper in the current shell process.  The 'start' task will launch
  the Wrapper as a spawned daemon process.
* Fixed a problem where missing environment variables specified in classpath
  or library path properties were not being handled correctly.
* Implemented feature request #676599 to enable the filtering of JVM output to
  trigger JVM restarts or Wrapper shutdowns.  See the new
  wrapper.filter.trigger.n and wrapper.filter.action.n properties.
* Modify the Win32 version of the Wrapper so that Environment Variables are
  always read from the system registry when the Wrapper is run as a service.
  By doing this, it makes it possible to change or add the system environment
  variables and have them take effect without having to first reboot the
  machine.
* Implemented cascading configuration files.
* Changed the default value for the wrapper.java.initmemory property to be 3Mb.
  The default on Windows and Linux JVMs is 2Mb, but the Solaris JVM requires
  a minimum of 3Mb.  The minimum value accepted by the Wrapper was changed
  from 8Mb to 1Mb to make it possible to reduce the footprint of applications
  to what is possible without using the wrapper.
* Improve the parsing of configuration files so that leading and trailing white
  space is now correctly trimmed.  It is also now possible to have comments at
  the end of a line containing a property.
* Modify the way exceptions thrown by an application's main method are
  presented to the user by the WrapperSimpleApp and WrapperStartStopApp so
  they no longer look like a problem with Wrapper configuration.

2.2.9
* Added a new property, wrapperper.restart.delay, which allows the user to control
  the amount of time to pause between a JVM exiting and a new JVM being
  launched.
* Fixed bug #611024. The Wrapper would sometimes fail to start if
  wrapper.max_failed_invocations is set to 1.
* Fix a problem where the number of non-daemon threads was not being calculated
  in some cases.
* Implemented feature request #491443.  Environment variables referenced in the
  wrapper.conf file will now be evaluated as the file is loaded.  The windows
  syntax for environment variables is used on all platforms to make them
  platform independent.
* Fixed a problem where the wrapper.conf was being open with both read and
  write locks when a read lock is all that is needed.  Made the wrapper fail
  on startup if another application held a read lock on the conf file.
* Modified the message displayed when the native library could not be found,
  so that it is much more descriptive.  Hopefully it will cut down on questions
  caused by configuration problems.
* Implemented feature request #613539. Modified the wrapper.java.library.path
  to function like the wrapper.java.classpath.n properties so that multiple
  directories can be specified in the library path in a platform independent
  way.  The old property is still supported, but deprecated.
* Fix Bug #632215.  The WrapperManager.isLaunchedAsService() method was always
  returning false, even when run as a service under Windows.  On linux, the
  Wrapper is always run as a console app, so this method will always return
  false.
* Improve the message thrown when user code attempts to access System.in from
  within a JVM being controlled by the Wrapper.  System.in will not work
  because the JVM is a spawned process.

2.2.8
* Fixed a compiler problem on Solaris some systems.
* Added a new property, wrapper.cpu.timeout, which allows the user to control
  how much time without receiving any CPU the Wrapper will tolerate before
  displaying a warning message.  The CPU timeout feature was added in 2.2.7
  but the default timeout of 10 seconds was not configurable.
* The Wrapper was only allowing 5 seconds between the JVM informing the
  Wrapper that it was going to exit and the JVM process actually exiting.
  This would cause the Wrapper to terminate the process prematurely in
  cases where an application shutdown thread took longer than 5 seconds to
  complete.  The Wrapper now allows wrapper.jvm_exit.timeout seconds for
  the JVM process to exit on its own before being forcibly terminated.
* When there is a configuration problem or a resource is unavailable, a JVM
  will sometimes exit abnormally very shortly after being launched.  This
  can lead the JVM being infinitely restarted due to a simple class
  path misconfiguration.  To work around this, the Wrapper has always had
  a hard limit of 5 restarts within a short period of time.  If the JVM
  has been running for more than a few minutes, then the count was reset.
  In this version, a new property. wrapper.max_failed_invocations was added
  to allow the max value to be set.   The time period which the JVM must
  now be running for the JVM launch to have been considered a success for
  restart purposes is set using the new wrapper.successful_invocation_time
  property.
* The number of advanced properties which most users do not need has been
  increasing as the Wrapper has been made more and more flexible.  This
  has been causing confusion in their usage by people who play with them
  without first reading the documentation.  To solve this, the advanced
  properties were removed from the default configuration file.  They still
  function.  But users must now read to the advanced configuration
  documentation to learn about their existence.  Added quite about to the
  descriptions of these properties to hopefully clear up any confusion
  about their usage.
* When the JVM exits abnormally, the Wrapper will pause for a few seconds
  before starting another JVM.  If the user pressed CTRL-C during this
  pause, a new JVM would still be launched.  The new JVM was exiting
  immediately but it was a waste of time.  The Wrapper now recognizes the
  event and aborts launching the new JVM.
* Added a page to the documentation which shows inline javadocs.  This
  will hopefully make it easier to navigate them as part of the full
  documentation set.
* Added a new method to the WrapperManager which enables user code to
  log at any log level.
* Added a new Helper class WrapperStartStopApp which allows users to easily
  integrate applications like Tomcat which use a separate class to stop
  the application.
* Added a samples section to the documentation.  Just includes Tomcat 4
  for now.

2.2.7
* Fix a problem where the JVM was trying to reconnect the Wrapper as it was
  being shutdown.  This was causing problems if the JVM was being restarted.
* Added support for the system being suspended to RAM or disk.  Also improved
  wrapper performance when a system is under 100% load.  See the new example
  output in the example section. 
* Fix a problem where the log output was not being directed to a file called
  wrapper.log in the same directory as the Wrapper binary in the event that the
  configured wrapper log file could not be accessed.
* Fix a problem where the Wrapper was not shutting down the JVM correctly when
  all non daemon threads completed.   Normally a JVM will exit when all of its
  non daemon threads have completed so this was causing some problems.
  (Thanks to Jung Tamas)
* Added the ability to set the priority of the Wrapper and its JVM when run
  as an NT service or console application.  The same thing can be better
  achieved on Unix systems by using "nice" in the shell script used to launch
  the Wrapper.  See the documentation for for details.
* JVM information was not being displayed correctly when the Wrapper native
  library could not be loaded.
* Added a new property to cause the wrapper to attempt to request a thread dump
  when the JVM does not exit on request.
* Improved the documentation of the WrapperSimpleApp and WrapperListener
  classes.
* Adding a new property wrapper.shutdown.timeout to allow the user to extend
  the length of time that an application is allowed to take shutting down.
* Rework the way the shutdown process works so that System.exit will never be
  called before the stop method in WrapperListener has had a chance to complete.
* Add a Restart button to the TestWrapper application.
* Fix a problem on Unix versions where '%' characters in Java output would
  sometimes cause the wrapper to crash.  Somehow missed getting this into the
  last release.
* Added a test to make sure that WrapperManager.stop is not called recursively.
* Added support for building under Windows XP.  Prebuilt installations had
  already been working. 

2.2.6
* Fix a problem where '%' characters in Java output would sometimes cause the
  wrapper to crash.  (Thanks to Frode Moe)
* Added support for requesting a Java thread dump without shutting down the
  Java process.
* Fixed a problem on windows where the java command was looking in the windows
  system and system32 directories for the java executable before checking the
  path when the full path to the java executable was not specified in the
  configuration file.  This could lead to different JVM being run from the
  Wrapper than was run if java -version was run from the command line.  The
  Wrapper will now attempt to resolve the full java path using the PATH
  environment variable.
* Added debug output showing Java version information when the JVM first
  starts.
* Modified c source to use /* */ style comments rather than // style comments.
  Some people were having problems with some compilers.

2.2.5
* Added support for service descriptions for Win2k and XP.
* Fixed bug issue when reading configuration files from Windows on Unix.
* Deprecated the wrapper.debug property in favor of loglevels.
* Added new logger functionality includes the following features:
  Loglevels like Log4j, NT Eventlog support, UNIX syslog support and rolling
  log files.
* Added wildcard support for classpath entries in wrapper.conf.
* Added the ability to specify configuration properties from the command line.
* Changed the way NT services are installed so that a patched version of the
  Wrapper.exe file no longer needs to be created to reference the
  wrapper.conf file.

2.2.4
* The value of APP_NAME in the bash or sh scripts no longer needs to be the
  same as the script.
* Added the ability to format and/or disable file logging and output to the
  console.
* Set mode of executables in binary release tar files so that they can be run
  without modification after being extracted.
* Fixed line feeds in release so that bat files are always CRLF, unix scripts
  are always LF.  Other source files are always CRLF in ZIP archives and LF
  in tar.gz archives.
* Make the build fail if Wrapper.exe or Wrapper.dll do not exist for Windows
  builds.
* Added an empty wrapper.log to the releases so that the TestWrapper example
  program runs out of the box.

2.2.3
* Added template scripts and conf files for ease of integration with other
  applications.
* Cleaned up the build.
* The WrapperSimpleApp method of launchine applications was not working 
  correctly with applications whose main method did not return.
* Add sample scripts and wrapper.conf files in the bin and lib directories.
  These scripts are used to start a sample application which runs out of the
  box.  See the new example.html page in the documentation for more details.
* Get rid of the platform specific directories in the bin and lib directories.
* Enable relative paths for Windows version.  In previous versions of Wrapper,
  it was necessary to always use absolute paths because the working directory 
  of the wrapper would be then NT System32 directory when run as a service.
* On the windows version, the wrapper always sets the current working
  directory to the location of the wrapper executable immediately after
  startup.
* Improvements to the documentation / web page.

2.2.2
* Added HTML based documentation.

2.2.1
* Added Linux and Solaris build files.
* Added Linux and Solaris documentation.

2.2.0
* Initial Public Release.
